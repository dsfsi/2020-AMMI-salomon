Speech to text translation in low resource Setting : LiSTra
============================================================

<!-- A short description of the project. -->

In this work we would like investigate the effectiveness of end-to-end architecture in opposite to pipeline approach by using the a transformer like architecture \cite{liu2019synchronous} and a custom attention mechanism that will weight both the speech recognition decoder with the translation decoder.
