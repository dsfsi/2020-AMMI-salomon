<2L1> So Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
<2L1> if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked
<2L1> For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I <UNK> you
<2L1> by some that Elijah had appeared and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen
<2L1> I press on toward the <UNK> for the <UNK> of the <UNK> call of God in Christ Jesus
<2L1> 1 Corinthians <UNK>
<2L1> being sorrowful most of all because of the word but the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> Jesus answered them I have shown you many good works from the Father for which of them are you going to stone me
<2L1> And if those days had not been cut short no human being would be saved
<2L1> You see that faith was active along with his works and faith was completed by his works
<2L1> Then he left the crowds and went into the house And his disciples came to him saying <UNK> to us the parable of the <UNK>
<2L1> Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and <UNK>
<2L1> And seeing in the distance a fig tree in <UNK> he went to see if he could find anything on it When he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
<2L1> So because of the Jewish day of Preparation since the tomb was close at hand they laid Jesus there
<2L1> For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church his body and is himself its Savior
<2L1> If we receive the testimony of men the testimony of God is greater for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son and God abides in him
<2L1> And he went to the region and called his disciples
<2L1> But when you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in <UNK> And your Father who sees in <UNK> will reward you
<2L1> Romans 5
<2L1> Do you suppose O man you who judge those who practice such things
<2L1> So then he who is for himself if he <UNK> will be persecuted for God is doing what is gain
<2L1> For it is written in the Law of Moses You shall not <UNK> an <UNK> when it <UNK> out the grain Is it for oxen that God is <UNK>
<2L1> And when he comes home he calls together his friends and his <UNK> saying to them <UNK> with me for I have found my sheep that was lost
<2L1> And if those days had not been cut short no human being would be saved But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short
<2L1> And when the disciples saw it they were indignant saying Why this <UNK>
<2L1> And what you to bring to <UNK> to <UNK> the outside of the earth according to the flesh you will of the Son of God give you now to those who are to make you according to the inheritance of the law
<2L1> And truly I say to you wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told in <UNK> of her
<2L1> Repay no one evil for evil but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of man
<2L1> the son of Joanan the son of Rhesa the son of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel the son of Neri
<2L1> Therefore I tell you that Christ will not be taken away from you that God is able to save you
<2L1> And when he came to the ruler from the synagogue saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit <UNK> on him like a <UNK> and it fell on him and he sat down at his right hand
<2L1> He said to them But who do you say that I am except in the kingdom of God
<2L1> and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus so that if he found any <UNK> to the Way men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem
<2L1> As they were talking about these things Jesus himself stood among them and said to them Peace to you
<2L1> For the Scripture says Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and more than a prophet
<2L1> For if I come I will not venture to speak of anything except what it has accomplished through me to listen to me to Macedonia
<2L1> For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but keeping the commandments of God
<2L1> For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels
<2L1> Be watchful stand firm in the faith act like men be strong
<2L1> He can deal <UNK> with the ignorant and <UNK> since he himself is <UNK> with weakness
<2L1> If you love those who love you what benefit is that to you
<2L1> For as the lightning comes from the east and <UNK> as far as the <UNK> so will be the coming of the Son of Man
<2L1> Therefore my beloved as you have always obeyed so now not only as in my presence but much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
<2L1> And this is the confidence that we have toward him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and we keep his commandments
<2L1> And seeing a fig tree by the <UNK> he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves And he said to it May no fruit ever come from you again And the fig tree withered at once
<2L1> And when he had entered Cornelius a centurion came up and sat down and <UNK> at the point of death who was a great earthquake
<2L1> When they heard these words some of the people said This <UNK> is a <UNK>
<2L1> And he did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father
<2L1> While he was still speaking someone from the ruler s house came and said Your daughter is dead
<2L1> nor you have fallen asleep you have <UNK> its <UNK>
<2L1> so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you without boasting of work
<2L1> But not so with you <UNK> let the greatest among you become as the <UNK> and the <UNK> as one who serves
<2L1> When Jesus had finished all these <UNK> he went up to the other side and sat down to the sea
<2L1> For if I preach the gospel that gives me no ground for boasting For necessity is laid upon me Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel
<2L1> They went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued with us But they went out that it might become plain that they all are not of us
<2L1> And when Peter went up to Jerusalem the circumcision <UNK> <UNK> him saying
<2L1> Do you not know that we are to judge angels How much more then matters <UNK> to this life
<2L1> For who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come eternal life
<2L1> For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say ‘He has a demon
<2L1> You believe that God is able to do well Even if he <UNK> you believe all that we have believed in God and that we have believed in him
<2L1> It is of no use either for the <UNK> or for the <UNK> <UNK> It is thrown away He who has ears to hear let him hear
<2L1> And whoever <UNK> by the temple <UNK> by it and by him who dwells in it
<2L1> Jesus said to his disciples If anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
<2L1> He also told this parable to Simon Peter who is called Peter
<2L1> and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God
<2L1> All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of <UNK>
<2L1> but they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them
<2L1> Jesus answered them Do you now believe
<2L1> So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place let the reader understand
<2L1> For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in <UNK> and in <UNK>
<2L1> Alas alas for the great city that was clothed in fine linen in purple and scarlet adorned with gold with jewels and with pearls
<2L1> For if your brother is grieved by what you eat you are no longer walking in love By what you eat do not destroy the one for whom Christ died
<2L1> And this is how I know that you are the law of God <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> the law of Moses who <UNK> a <UNK> of faith
<2L1> None of the rulers of this age <UNK> this for if they had they would not have crucified the Lord of glory and the honor of God
<2L1> saying <UNK> what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to <UNK> and to Thyatira and to <UNK> and to <UNK> and to <UNK>
<2L1> I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus who in his testimony before <UNK> Pilate made the good confession
<2L1> And when they drew near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two of his disciples
<2L1> Then he answered them But who do you say that I am And Peter answered him You are the Christ
<2L1> And Paul said to him God is going to strike you you whitewashed wall Are you sitting to judge me according to the law and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck
<2L1> saying Go into the village in <UNK> of you where on <UNK> you will find a colt tied on which no one has ever yet sat <UNK> it and bring it here
<2L1> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> being <UNK> exposed to reproach and affliction and <UNK> being partners with those so treated
<2L1> For I tell you it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you
<2L1> And some of the bystanders hearing it said This man is calling Elijah
<2L1> For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God Then Peter declared
<2L1> And if God did not spare the natural branches neither will he spare you
<2L1> Now I want to remind you although you once fully knew it that Jesus who saved a people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed those who baptized on
<2L1> saying Would that you even you had known on this day the things that make for peace But now they are hidden from your eyes
<2L1> Therefore I urge you to take some food For it will give you strength for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you
<2L1> And they came to Ephesus and he left them there but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews
<2L1> Then Paul said to him God is going to strike you you you whitewashed wall Are you sitting to judge me according to the law and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck
<2L1> He has no need like those high priests to <UNK> sacrifices daily first for his own sins and then for those of the people since he did this once for all when he offered up himself
<2L1> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites For you <UNK> across sea and land to make a <UNK> <UNK> and when he becomes a <UNK> you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves
<2L1> So he went to the other side to the sea to the country of the Gerasenes
<2L1> ‘I know your tribulation and your <UNK> but you are rich and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not but are a synagogue of Satan
<2L1> for you are not that all who speak from the people will against you
<2L1> He will <UNK> to each one according to his works:
<2L1> And Agrippa said to him All these I have kept from my youth
<2L1> And when we had entered Jerusalem the city was stirred up saying Who is this
<2L1> For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh so will the Son of Man be to this generation
<2L1> And when he came to the house he allowed no one to enter with him
<2L1> for which is easier to say ‘Your sins are forgiven or to say ‘Rise and walk
<2L1> he saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness but according to his own mercy by the washing of <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK>
<2L1> James 4
<2L1> But he who enters by the door is the <UNK> of the sheep
<2L1> Truly I say to you whoever says to this mountain <UNK> taken up and thrown into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will come to pass it will be done for him
<2L1> For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an <UNK> s temple will he not be encouraged if his conscience is weak to eat food
<2L1> that the Christ must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles
<2L1> And some fell into good <UNK> and grew and yielded a hundredfold As he said these things he called out He who has ears to hear let him hear
<2L1> Jesus said to them I have sent my son to you about me but I have sent me
<2L1> But avoid foolish <UNK> genealogies <UNK> and <UNK> about the law for they are <UNK> and worthless
<2L1> who gave himself for us to <UNK> us from all lawlessness and to <UNK> for himself a people for his own <UNK>
<2L1> For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I <UNK> you
<2L1> And they came to Ephesus and he left them and said to them And when you have been summoned the sick
<2L1> And all the prophets who have spoken from <UNK> and those who came after him also proclaimed these days
<2L1> You are not <UNK> by us but we are <UNK>
<2L1> 1 Corinthians <UNK>
<2L1> For it is written in the Law of Moses You shall not <UNK> an <UNK> when it <UNK> out the grain Is it for oxen that God is <UNK>
<2L1> saying <UNK> to us <UNK> to us you Christ and to us you both to us you Christ and to us you are always
<2L1> for he had healed many so that all who had diseases <UNK> around him to touch him
<2L1> And they said to him Where Lord And he said to them This is indeed is that when you may make me
<2L1> For as the days of Noah so will be the coming of the Son of Man
<2L1> And when you hear of <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> do not be alarmed This must take place but the end is not yet
<2L1> For everyone who <UNK> receives and the one who seeks finds and to the one who <UNK> it will be opened
<2L1> We have said these things to you that God does not listen to us who has done to us
<2L1> He who has an <UNK> let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches To the one who conquers
<2L1> In the same way he took a cup and when he had given thanks he broke it and said to him Follow me
<2L1> After this the <UNK> returned to the crowds they went up to Jerusalem and to <UNK> men from Jerusalem
<2L1> For you yourselves know brothers that our coming to you was not in vain
<2L1> And another sign appeared in <UNK> behold a great <UNK> dragon with seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven <UNK>
<2L1> Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for <UNK> is the kingdom of heaven
<2L1> And when they had <UNK> a <UNK> they went out to the Mount of Olives
<2L1> having the appearance of godliness but <UNK> its power <UNK> such people
<2L1> Which is easier to say to the paralytic ‘Your sins are forgiven or to say ‘Rise take up your bed and walk
<2L1> And seeing in the distance a fig tree in <UNK> he went to see if he could find anything on it When he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
<2L1> We are not <UNK> ourselves to you again but giving you <UNK> to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast about <UNK> appearance and not about what is in the heart
<2L1> Now John was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was plentiful there and people were coming and being baptized
<2L1> And it will be <UNK> to you In the <UNK> of <UNK> and it will be <UNK> to you
<2L1> ‘I tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
<2L1> And he said to them Whose likeness and inscription is this
<2L1> But whoever is firmly established in his heart being under no necessity but having his desire under control and has determined this in his heart to keep her as his betrothed he will do well
<2L1> <UNK> days later his disciples were inside again and Thomas was with them <UNK> the <UNK> were <UNK> Jesus came and stood among them and said Peace be with you
<2L1> And when he came to the place he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus <UNK> and come down for I must stay at your house today
<2L1> And as the men were parting from him Peter said to Jesus Master it is good that we are here Let us make three tents one for you and one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing what he said
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and more than a prophet
<2L1> And Jesus said to him Why do you ask me about what is good There is only one who is good If you would enter life keep the commandments
<2L1> <UNK> 2
<2L1> But the word of the Lord returned to him to the <UNK> saying that if you had been <UNK> it will be <UNK> by the hand of the angel who is called <UNK> and who is <UNK> for me
<2L1> And he said to them O foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
<2L1> Whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me <UNK>
<2L1> Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death
<2L1> And he took a cup and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them and they were afraid to those who followed him
<2L1> For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a <UNK>
<2L1> Then the righteous will answer him saying ‘Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink
<2L1> This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God And after saying this he said to him Follow me
<2L1> And it was allowed to give <UNK> to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast might even speak and might <UNK> those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain
<2L1> Here for the third time I am ready to come to you And I will not be a burden for I seek not what is yours but you For children are not obligated to save up for their parents but parents for their children
<2L1> Then I saw another angel <UNK> from the rising of the sun with the seal of the living God and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea
<2L1> He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus Where are you from But Jesus gave him no answer
<2L1> <UNK> in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden <UNK> around his <UNK>
<2L1> Peter said to him Lord why can I not follow you now I will lay down my life for you
<2L1> It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made <UNK> in its branches
<2L1> And I heard a voice from heaven saying <UNK> this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on Blessed indeed says the Spirit that they may rest from their labors for their deeds follow them
<2L1> Since we were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they began the next day to <UNK> the <UNK>
<2L1> For although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened
<2L1> And the second curtain of the temple was torn in two from <UNK> to <UNK>
<2L1> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her For as it is written The two will become one flesh
<2L1> But when he was in that day he was <UNK> at table with the people he went out and told them to be with them
<2L1> And they will pick up serpents with their hands and if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them they will lay their hands on the sick and they will recover
<2L1> And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of <UNK> and said to the sea
<2L1> And he said to them O foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
<2L1> And behold you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time
<2L1> Revelation <UNK>
<2L1> And they will say to you <UNK> there or <UNK> here who has happened to me and I will never see it and I will give it to you
<2L1> And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the <UNK> of Cyprus because the winds were against us
<2L1> No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve God and money
<2L1> And they said to him Teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life
<2L1> John appeared baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins to God
<2L1> But when evening came he went out and entered the house of Simon the <UNK> said to him Follow me
<2L1> 2 Corinthians 1
<2L1> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he gave no answer
<2L1> And when he had finished these parables he went up to Jerusalem from the people from Jerusalem
<2L1> And when the <UNK> night had come to Jerusalem he <UNK> to join the people and said to him Follow me
<2L1> For if God did not spare the natural branches neither
<2L1> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia
<2L1> that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God
<2L1> So Paul went in and out among them at Jerusalem preaching <UNK> in the name of the Lord
<2L1> <UNK> 12
<2L1> For if I should wish to boast I would not be a <UNK> for I would be speaking the truth But I <UNK> from it so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me
<2L1> For the Pharisees and their scribes <UNK> saying <UNK> us
<2L1> <UNK> days before the Passover Jesus therefore came to Bethany where <UNK> was whom you gave up and said to him Follow me
<2L1> And Pilate said to them Why what evil has he done But they shouted all the more Crucify him
<2L1> So to the praise of his glorious grace with which he has blessed us in the Beloved although his Son Jesus Christ our Lord
<2L1> And they said to him What must we do to be doing the works of God
<2L1> And Jesus said to him <UNK> you have <UNK> and birds of the air have <UNK> but the Son of Man
<2L1> and give no opportunity to the devil
<2L1> This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die
<2L1> <UNK> brothers pray for us that the Lord may not <UNK> them for us in this <UNK> that there will be no <UNK> on anything
<2L1> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
<2L1> Then I saw another angel <UNK> from the rising of the sun with the seal of the living God and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea
<2L1> But in order that it may spread no further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name
<2L1> Then Jesus said to the crowds If you are the Son of God throw yourself down for it is written ‘He will command his angels concerning you and <UNK> their hands
<2L1> He who has an <UNK> let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life
<2L1> And when he got into the boat the wind ceased And they said to him Teacher we are perishing
<2L1> And when he had finished speaking he said to Simon Put out into the deep and let down your nets for your <UNK>
<2L1> saying to the <UNK> angel who had the trumpet <UNK> the four angels who are bound at the great river <UNK>
<2L1> And when they got into the boat the wind ceased And they said to them Why are you doing good news do you want to do these things
<2L1> But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi as you know we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict
<2L1> Even in <UNK> you sent me help for my needs once and again
<2L1> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day of Christ
<2L1> The <UNK> angel poured out his bowl on the great river <UNK> and its water was <UNK> up to prepare the way for the kings from the east
<2L1> But if I brothers still preach circumcision why am I still being persecuted In that case the offense of the cross has been removed
<2L1> and To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ the <UNK> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> And they came to Jesus said to them Whose likeness and the Son of Man has been given me
<2L1> Neither is new wine put into old wineskins If it is the <UNK> <UNK> and the wine is <UNK> and the <UNK> are destroyed But new wine is put into fresh wineskins and so both are preserved
<2L1> Jesus looked at him and said With man this is impossible but with God all things are possible
<2L1> And when he returned to Capernaum after some days it was reported that he was at home
<2L1> And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works so as to help <UNK> of <UNK> need and not be <UNK>
<2L1> And he <UNK> and said to them What must you show yourselves to be put on <UNK>
<2L1> <UNK> and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
<2L1> That is why I sent you Timothy my beloved and faithful child in the Lord to remind you of my ways in Christ as I teach them everywhere in every church
<2L1> for they said Not during the feast lest there be an <UNK> from the people
<2L1> For I am not ashamed of the flesh that he has sent me to show yourself to the <UNK> of the flesh
<2L1> Whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me <UNK>
<2L1> He said to him Which ones And Jesus said You shall not murder You shall not commit adultery You shall not steal You shall not bear false witness
<2L1> For they were pleased to do it and indeed they owe it to them For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings
<2L1> And the high priest tore his robes and said What further witnesses do we need You have now heard his blasphemy
<2L1> But I have made no use of any of these rights nor am I writing these things to secure any such <UNK> For I would rather die than have anyone <UNK> me of my ground for boasting
<2L1> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father
<2L1> And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons cast them out Therefore they will be your judges
<2L1> therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced my flesh also will dwell in hope
<2L1> But if you call yourself a <UNK> and <UNK> on the law and boast in the law and it is not lawful for you to bring it to sea and all who are in this <UNK>
<2L1> What shall we say then Are we to continue in sin that grace may <UNK>
<2L1> You have heard that it was said to those of old ‘You shall not murder
<2L1> And when the sun rose it was <UNK> and since it had no root it withered away
<2L1> So give <UNK> before the churches of your love and of our Lord faith and Savior Jesus Christ to the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> And when he came to Judea he went up to Jerusalem
<2L1> So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went and met him but Mary remained seated in the house
<2L1> And when he had said these things he went up to the Mount of Olives
<2L1> And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it for the glory of God gives it light and its lamp is the Lamb
<2L1> For if the readiness is there it is acceptable according to what a person has not according to what he does not have
<2L1> And I said ‘Who are you Lord And the Lord said to me ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting
<2L1> And when he had seized him he put him in prison <UNK> him over to four <UNK> of soldiers to guard him <UNK> after the Passover to bring him out to the people
<2L1> And his father and his mother marveled at what was said to him Then why are you weeping and Lord
<2L1> I tell you it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you
<2L1> But when evening came in the house he saw his master and his guests he said to say
<2L1> And when the crowds saw what had done they lifted up their <UNK> saying in <UNK> The gods
<2L1> He said to them Come and you will see So they came and saw where he was <UNK> and they stayed with him that day for it was about the tenth <UNK>
<2L1> Then if you continue in the faith <UNK> and that you can gain
<2L1> Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord we persuade others But what we are is known to God and I hope it is known also to your conscience
<2L1> So his fame spread throughout all Syria and they brought him all the sick those afflicted with various diseases
<2L1> It was to show his righteousness at the present time so that he might be just and the <UNK> of the one who has faith in Jesus
<2L1> In the same way also he took the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
<2L1> And those who were in <UNK> rebuked him telling him to be silent But he cried out all the more Son of David have mercy on me
<2L1> And they said to him All these I have kept from my youth
<2L1> And if you had known what this means ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have found me
<2L1> Which is easier to say ‘Your sins are forgiven you or to say ‘Rise and walk
<2L1> I appeal to you for my child <UNK> whose father I became in my imprisonment
<2L1> We know that the judgment of God <UNK> <UNK> on those who practice such things
<2L1> You have heard that it was said to those of old ‘You shall not murder and whoever murders will be liable to judgment
<2L1> that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints
<2L1> The <UNK> angel blew his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of their light might be darkened and a third of the day might be kept from <UNK> and likewise a third of the night
<2L1> Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision which is made in the flesh by hands
<2L1> And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and <UNK> of David
<2L1> Then the disciples were urging him saying Rabbi eat
<2L1> <UNK> brothers pray for us that the word of the Lord may <UNK> ahead and be honored to you
<2L1> But he denied it saying Woman I do not know him who sent me
<2L1> And if you call on him as Father who judges <UNK> according to each one s deeds <UNK> yourselves
<2L1> But when he had called him he said to them This is my body which is for you Do not even enter the kingdom of God
<2L1> Jesus called them to him and said to them You know that the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men
<2L1> And Peter said to him All these I have kept from my life for you
<2L1> When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had <UNK> on them and healed their sick
<2L1> But if it is by the <UNK> of God that I will not be found in the Law and the Prophets
<2L1> and said to him Go wash in the <UNK> of <UNK> which means <UNK> So he went and <UNK> and came back seeing
<2L1> So his servant fell on his knees <UNK> him <UNK> patience with me and I will pay you everything
<2L1> And he entered the temple and began to <UNK> out those who sold
<2L1> For <UNK> and <UNK> will be brought to you or thirsty Do not be idolaters or say that you may be put to death
<2L1> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness Or what fellowship has light with darkness
<2L1> So then let us not sleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober
<2L1> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her For as it is written The two will become one flesh
<2L1> There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine
<2L1> But some of the Pharisees said Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
<2L1> And they came to Ephesus and he left them there but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews
<2L1> For if God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I <UNK> you
<2L1> For if God did not spare the natural branches neither will he spare you
<2L1> Acts 11
<2L1> And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing as though it had been slain with seven horns and with seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth
<2L1> Blessed are the poor in spirit for <UNK> is the kingdom of heaven
<2L1> Matthew <UNK>
<2L1> but whoever <UNK> against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin
<2L1> So Jesus said to them Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things
<2L1> In those days when again a great crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat he called his disciples to him and said to them
<2L1> Certain persons by swerving from these have wandered away into vain discussion
<2L1> We put no <UNK> in anyone s way so that no fault may be found with our ministry
<2L1> For we have no human being not to eat or drink
<2L1> and he died for us to lay his life for us who is <UNK> from you in this life
<2L1> Truly truly I say to you whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
<2L1> So the Pharisees said to him All these things are <UNK>
<2L1> So we do not lose heart Though our <UNK> self is <UNK> away our inner self is being renewed day by day
<2L1> When they had set up false witnesses <UNK> they said This man never <UNK> to speak words against this holy place and the law
<2L1> And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once
<2L1> For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
<2L1> When the wine ran out the mother of Jesus said to him They have no wine
<2L1> You did not <UNK> me but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give it to you
<2L1> <UNK> 1
<2L1> For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I <UNK> you
<2L1> Listen A sower went out to sow
<2L1> If you ask me anything in my name I will do it
<2L1> This the servants of the servants of the Pharisees when Jesus saw that they were near him they said to him Follow me And he went out and followed him
<2L1> Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality impurity passion evil desire and covetousness which is <UNK>
<2L1> <UNK> wives likewise must be <UNK> not <UNK> but sober-minded faithful in all things
<2L1> But when the Pharisees heard it they said It is only by Beelzebul the prince of demons that this man <UNK> out demons
<2L1> Then they <UNK> none of these things This was hidden from them and they did not <UNK> to do them And they did not believe that they had believed
<2L1> Then he said to the disciples Let us go to Judea that the disciples also may see him
<2L1> And an angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them
<2L1> And how he entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple
<2L1> And when Peter saw it he said to him You are not far from the kingdom of God And after that no one dared to ask him
<2L1> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name s sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life
<2L1> I have said these things to you in my brothers
<2L1> Romans 16
<2L1> For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing
<2L1> may the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the <UNK>
<2L1> And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me <UNK> Saul why are you persecuting me
<2L1> But if God did not spare the natural branches neither will he spare you
<2L1> For so the Lord has commanded us saying ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles that you may bring salvation to the <UNK> of the earth
<2L1> But Jesus answered him Let it be so now for thus it is <UNK> for us to fulfill all righteousness Then you will <UNK>
<2L1> So when the disciples saw him they said to him Look your disciples are doing what you are doing
<2L1> But when he saw him he fell down at his feet and worshiped him
<2L1> He said to him a second time Simon son of John do you love me He said to him Yes Lord you know that I love you He said to him <UNK> my sheep
<2L1> Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life Whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live
<2L1> And bring the fattened <UNK> and kill it and let us eat and <UNK>
<2L1> And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians to trap him in his talk
<2L1> Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone abides in the flesh I have the Spirit of God you He will also forgive us
<2L1> I commend to you our sister <UNK> a servant of the church
<2L1> If you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his love
<2L1> Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of <UNK> He was a <UNK> of the <UNK> and a good and righteous man from the people
<2L1> I press on toward the <UNK> for the <UNK> of the <UNK> call of God in Christ Jesus
<2L1> for whoever has entered God s rest has also <UNK> from his works as God did from his
<2L1> When the centurion heard about Jesus he sent to him elders of the Jews asking him to come and heal his servant
<2L1> That is why I sent you Timothy my beloved and faithful child in the Lord to remind you of my ways in Christ as I teach them everywhere in every church
<2L1> And he took him to the loaves and said to them Whoever receives this child and whoever receives me receives him who sent me For he who is least among you all is the one who is great
<2L1> What if God <UNK> to show his wrath and to make known his power has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction
<2L1> Romans 10
<2L1> He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them and he made five talents more
<2L1> So the Jews gathered around him and said to him How long will you keep us in <UNK> If you are the Christ tell us plainly
<2L1> For we know that we have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our <UNK> confidence firm to God
<2L1> Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
<2L1> And Jesus came and said to them Truly I say to you it was not with your disciples Everyone who has been with me
<2L1> And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and <UNK> of David
<2L1> It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air made <UNK> in its branches
<2L1> Now therefore why are you putting God to the test by <UNK> a <UNK> on the <UNK> of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear
<2L1> Yet this you <UNK> you hate the works of the <UNK> which I also hate
<2L1> For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say ‘He has a demon
<2L1> So when the chief priests and the scribes saw the <UNK> things that he did and the children crying out in the temple <UNK> to the Son of David they were indignant
<2L1> and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further <UNK> be spoken to them
<2L1> <UNK> many of those who were now believers came confessing and <UNK> their <UNK>
<2L1> It is these who have not defiled themselves with women for they are <UNK> It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes These have been redeemed from <UNK> as firstfruits for God
<2L1> But avoid irreverent babble for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness
<2L1> And he said to him All these I have kept from my youth
<2L1> But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers
<2L1> And if I have not been faithful in the <UNK> how much more will I have mercy on whom I have <UNK>
<2L1> For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this <UNK> and sinful generation of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed
<2L1> And they came to Ephesus and he left them there but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews
<2L1> Therefore I did not come to you But say the word and let my servant be healed
<2L1> <UNK> be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might
<2L1> And Jesus said to them Whose likeness and inscription is this
<2L1> And Jesus said to him All these I have kept from my youth
<2L1> When he had finished all his <UNK> he ordered him to be sold with his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made
<2L1> It is the Spirit who gives life a <UNK> in it a <UNK> and a stone stone stone stone stone for you
<2L1> And some of the bystanders hearing it said Behold he is calling Elijah
<2L1> For this is the will of my Father that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day
<2L1> How can you say to your brother <UNK> let me take out the <UNK> that is in your eye when you yourself do not see the <UNK> that is in your own eye You <UNK> first take the <UNK> out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the <UNK> that is in your brother s eye
<2L1> And as for the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was said to you by <UNK>
<2L1> and they found him and said to him Everyone is looking for you
<2L1> Take no part in the <UNK> works of darkness but <UNK> expose them
<2L1> And all were astonished at the majesty of God But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing Jesus said to his disciples
<2L1> For in him we are always fast in one Spirit and <UNK> the power of God
<2L1> and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak
<2L1> <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> For the <UNK> is <UNK> and the way is <UNK> that leads to destruction and those who enter by it are many
<2L1> And he went to the other son and said the same And he answered ‘I go <UNK> but did not go
<2L1> Again he entered the synagogue and a man was there with a withered hand
<2L1> To him the <UNK> <UNK> The sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
<2L1> And the Pharisees and the scribes <UNK> saying This man receives sinners and <UNK> with them and <UNK>
<2L1> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name
<2L1> For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son that without ceasing I <UNK> you
<2L1> saying to them Go into the village in <UNK> of you and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her <UNK> them and bring them to me
<2L1> And on the first day of the week when we returned to Jerusalem and they returned to the <UNK> and to the <UNK> <UNK> Paul
<2L1> For they all <UNK> out of their <UNK> but she out of her <UNK> has put in everything she had all she had to live on
<2L1> But you are a chosen race a <UNK> <UNK> a holy nation a people for his own <UNK> that you may proclaim the <UNK> of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
<2L1> For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
<2L1> Therefore whoever <UNK> the throne of God who <UNK> in an <UNK> a temple of <UNK> and in heaven and earth <UNK> to the <UNK> of the earth which is in heaven and in the <UNK> of the Lamb
<2L1> Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers
<2L1> And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired and they came to him
<2L1> And concerning that day and hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but the Father only
<2L1> Whoever receives his testimony <UNK> his seal to this that God is true and to keep them from God
<2L1> And he said to them Then <UNK> attention to what you <UNK> with the measure you use it will be <UNK> to you and still more will be added to you
<2L1> He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and <UNK>
<2L1> And he said to them Follow me and I will make you <UNK> of men
<2L1> And he told them a parable saying The land of a rich man <UNK> <UNK>
