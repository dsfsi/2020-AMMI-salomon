<2L1> So there was a <UNK> among the people over him
<2L1> For man was not made from woman but woman from man
<2L1> For when we were with you we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction just as it has come to pass and just as you know
<2L1> While we were <UNK> for many days a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea
<2L1> I <UNK> brothers by my <UNK> in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die every day
<2L1> 1 Corinthians <UNK>
<2L1> that the man of God may be <UNK> <UNK> for every good work
<2L1> Jesus answered him What I am doing you do not understand now but afterward you will understand
<2L1> If then David calls him Lord how is he his son
<2L1> Lord now you are <UNK> your servant depart in peace according to your word
<2L1> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the <UNK> called <UNK> which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath day s journey away
<2L1> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had <UNK> been blind
<2L1> So Ananias departed and entered the house And laying his hands on him he said <UNK> Saul the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may <UNK> your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit
<2L1> And immediately he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him
<2L1> But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ the head of a wife is her husband and the head of Christ is God
<2L1> This is he who came by water and blood Jesus Christ not by the water only but by the water and the blood And the Spirit is the one who testifies because the Spirit is the truth
<2L1> And he went down to Capernaum a city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the Sabbath
<2L1> Come to <UNK> quickly with your <UNK> while you are going with him to court lest your <UNK> hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you be put in prison
<2L1> Romans 5
<2L1> But rise and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do
<2L1> <UNK> yourselves therefore to God <UNK> the devil and he will flee from you
<2L1> From now on therefore we regard no one according to the flesh Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh we regard him thus no longer
<2L1> So I sent for you at once and you have been kind enough to come Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord
<2L1> And the next day he took out two <UNK> and gave them to the <UNK> saying <UNK> care of him and whatever more you <UNK> I will repay you when I come back
<2L1> And they had then a <UNK> prisoner called Barabbas
<2L1> having the eyes of your hearts <UNK> that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints
<2L1> Again I tell you it is easier for a <UNK> to go through the eye of a <UNK> than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God
<2L1> Greet my <UNK> <UNK> Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of Judah
<2L1> Brothers sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who fear God to us has been sent the message of this salvation
<2L1> And they laughed at him But he put them all outside and took the child s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
<2L1> He said In a <UNK> city there was a judge who neither feared God nor <UNK> man
<2L1> When the angel who spoke to him had departed he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who <UNK> him
<2L1> And immediately the girl got up and began walking for she was twelve years of age and they were immediately overcome with amazement
<2L1> For as it is written The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you
<2L1> For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship
<2L1> For the sake of Christ then I am content with <UNK> <UNK> hardships persecutions and calamities For when I am weak then I am strong
<2L1> For there are many who are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> especially those of the circumcision <UNK>
<2L1> For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or if you accept a different gospel from the one you <UNK> you put up with it <UNK> enough
<2L1> If one <UNK> <UNK> all suffer together if one <UNK> is honored all rejoice together
<2L1> You made him for a little while <UNK> than the angels you have <UNK> him with glory and honor
<2L1> Truly I say to you he will set him over all his possessions
<2L1> For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other so will the Son of Man be in his day
<2L1> Likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God
<2L1> I warn everyone who hears the words of the <UNK> of this <UNK> if anyone <UNK> to them God will add to him the plagues <UNK> in this book
<2L1> And after she was baptized and her household as well she urged us saying If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come to my house and stay And she <UNK> upon us
<2L1> After he stayed among them not more than <UNK> or ten days he went down to Caesarea And the next day he took his seat on the <UNK> and ordered Paul to be brought
<2L1> And when it grew <UNK> his disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the hour is now <UNK>
<2L1> And he had to pass through <UNK>
<2L1> While they were talking and discussing together Jesus himself drew near and went with them
<2L1> Let each of us <UNK> his neighbor for his good to build him up
<2L1> so that we would not be <UNK> by Satan for we are not ignorant of his <UNK>
<2L1> But if he does not listen take one or two others along with you that every charge may be established by the <UNK> of two or three witnesses
<2L1> This is how one should regard us as servants of Christ and <UNK> of the <UNK> of God
<2L1> and through him to <UNK> to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
<2L1> There is no fear in love but perfect love <UNK> out fear For fear has to do with <UNK> and whoever <UNK> has not been perfected in love
<2L1> and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem <UNK> for him
<2L1> If any of you <UNK> wisdom let him ask God who gives <UNK> to all without reproach and it will be given him
<2L1> And no one after drinking old wine desires new for he says ‘The old is good
<2L1> so practice and observe whatever they tell you but not what they do For they preach but do not practice
<2L1> yet for love s sake I <UNK> to appeal to you I Paul an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus
<2L1> who devour widows houses and for a <UNK> make long prayers They will receive the greater condemnation
<2L1> And he was longing to be <UNK> with the <UNK> that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything
<2L1> And he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years
<2L1> He will not <UNK> or cry <UNK> nor will anyone hear his voice in the <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK>
<2L1> But Saul who was also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit looked <UNK> at him
<2L1> blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not <UNK> his sin
<2L1> Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again
<2L1> The <UNK> of the <UNK> will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the <UNK> of the earth to hear the wisdom of <UNK> and behold something greater than <UNK> is here
<2L1> For I do not want to see you now just in passing I hope to <UNK> some time with you if the Lord permits
<2L1> Our fathers refused to obey him but <UNK> him aside and in their hearts they turned to Egypt
<2L1> For they <UNK> <UNK> this fact that the heavens existed long ago and the earth was <UNK> out of water and through water by the word of God
<2L1> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these <UNK> without <UNK> doing nothing from partiality
<2L1> <UNK> waves of the sea casting up the <UNK> of their own shame <UNK> stars for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever
<2L1> For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her and the <UNK> of the earth have <UNK> rich from the power of her <UNK> living
<2L1> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and by his appearing and his <UNK>
<2L1> Now about <UNK> days after these <UNK> he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray
<2L1> They answered him Abraham is our father Jesus said to them If you were Abraham s children you would be doing the works Abraham did
<2L1> And Paul said John baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is Jesus
<2L1> But if that servant says to himself <UNK> master is <UNK> in coming and <UNK> to beat the <UNK> and <UNK> servants and to eat and drink and get drunk
<2L1> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out they would have had opportunity to return
<2L1> For from within out of the heart of man come evil thoughts sexual immorality <UNK> murder adultery
<2L1> And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter
<2L1> And the child grew and became strong filled with wisdom And the favor of God was upon him
<2L1> Do not be <UNK> in the laying on of hands nor take part in the sins of others keep yourself pure
<2L1> Now this may be <UNK> <UNK> these women are two <UNK> One is from Mount <UNK> <UNK> children for <UNK> she is <UNK>
<2L1> And in his teaching he said <UNK> of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the <UNK>
<2L1> And it has often cast him into fire and into water to destroy him But if you can do anything have <UNK> on us and help us
<2L1> but they went on from <UNK> and came to Antioch in <UNK> And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down
<2L1> Then Paul answered What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart For I am ready not only to be <UNK> but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus
<2L1> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised so that righteousness would be counted to them as well
<2L1> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites For you <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and have <UNK> the <UNK> matters of the <UNK> justice and mercy and <UNK> These you ought to have done without <UNK> the others
<2L1> So put away all malice and all deceit and <UNK> and envy and all slander
<2L1> and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more and the voice of bridegroom and <UNK> will be heard in you no more for your <UNK> were the great ones of the earth and all nations were deceived by your <UNK>
<2L1> But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will
<2L1> They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
<2L1> And calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them
<2L1> to take the place in this ministry and <UNK> from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place
<2L1> For as the Father <UNK> the dead and gives them life so also the Son gives life to whom he will
<2L1> And her <UNK> and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
<2L1> <UNK> wickedness deceit sensuality envy slander <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> just as you did <UNK> acknowledge us that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you
<2L1> James 4
<2L1> I am the good <UNK> The good <UNK> <UNK> down his life for the sheep
<2L1> The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet s reward and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person s reward
<2L1> For even when we were with you we would give you this <UNK> If anyone is not willing to work let him not eat
<2L1> And his name by faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and know and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all
<2L1> As for what was sown on good <UNK> this is the one who hears the word and <UNK> it He indeed bears fruit and <UNK> in one case a hundredfold in another <UNK> and in another thirty
<2L1> He had still one other a beloved son <UNK> he sent him to them saying ‘They will <UNK> my son
<2L1> But if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for members of his household he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
<2L1> I do not write these things to make you ashamed but to <UNK> you as my beloved children
<2L1> who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels authorities and powers having been subjected to him
<2L1> And when they had come up to <UNK> they <UNK> to go into Bithynia but the Spirit of Jesus did not <UNK> them
<2L1> But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets that his Christ would suffer he thus fulfilled
<2L1> <UNK> therefore lest what is said in the Prophets should come <UNK>
<2L1> 1 Corinthians 9
<2L1> For this very reason make every <UNK> to <UNK> your faith with <UNK> and <UNK> with knowledge
<2L1> and said You son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness full of all deceit and <UNK> will you not <UNK> making crooked the straight paths of the Lord
<2L1> who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was about to <UNK> at Jerusalem
<2L1> And they said Look Lord here are two swords And he said to them It is enough
<2L1> Fear not little flock for it is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom
<2L1> And these will go away into eternal <UNK> but the righteous into eternal life
<2L1> For to the one who has more will be given and he will have an <UNK> but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
<2L1> We found the prison <UNK> <UNK> and the guards standing at the <UNK> but when we opened them we found no one inside
<2L1> And if anyone s name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
<2L1> And at once the man was healed and he took up his bed and walked Now that day was the Sabbath
<2L1> On a Sabbath while he was going through the grainfields his disciples <UNK> and ate some heads of grain <UNK> them in their hands
<2L1> For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you
<2L1> And one of the elders said to me <UNK> no more behold the <UNK> of the tribe of Judah the <UNK> of David has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals
<2L1> Why do you see the <UNK> that is in your brother s eye but do not <UNK> the <UNK> that is in your own eye
<2L1> And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves
<2L1> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord s death until he comes
<2L1> This is he of whom it is written ‘Behold I send my <UNK> before your face who will prepare your way before you
<2L1> When he realized this he went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark where many were gathered together and were praying
<2L1> though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad in order that God s purpose of <UNK> might continue not because of works but because of him who calls
<2L1> but the boat by this time was a long way from the land <UNK> by the waves for the wind was against them
<2L1> And he will show you a large upper room <UNK> and ready there prepare for us
<2L1> But all these things they will do to you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
<2L1> saying This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you
<2L1> The Lord will <UNK> me from every evil deed and bring me <UNK> into his heavenly kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen
<2L1> <UNK> the <UNK> son of <UNK> accompanied him and of the <UNK> Aristarchus and <UNK> and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>
<2L1> And when they came to Jesus they <UNK> with him earnestly saying He is worthy to have you do this for him
<2L1> And after there had been much debate Peter stood up and said to them Brothers you know that in the early days God made a <UNK> among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who <UNK> soft clothing are in kings houses
<2L1> And Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down
<2L1> <UNK> 10
<2L1> But on the next day <UNK> to know the <UNK> reason why he was being accused by the Jews he <UNK> him and commanded the chief priests and all the <UNK> to meet and he brought Paul down and set him before them
<2L1> If you are the Christ tell us But he said to them If I tell you you will not believe
<2L1> But I have this against you that you have <UNK> the love you had at first
<2L1> <UNK> likewise must be <UNK> not <UNK> not <UNK> to much wine not greedy for dishonest gain
<2L1> And rising very early in the morning while it was still dark he departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed
<2L1> Who shall bring any charge against God s elect It is God who <UNK>
<2L1> They do all their deeds to be seen by others For they make their <UNK> broad and their <UNK> long
<2L1> This is the disciple who is <UNK> witness about these things and who has written these things and we know that his testimony is true
<2L1> And the beast that I saw was like a <UNK> its feet were like a bear s and its mouth was like a lion s mouth And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority
<2L1> Do not speak evil against one another brothers The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks evil against the law and judges the law But if you judge the law you are not a <UNK> of the law but a judge
<2L1> And at that hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven
<2L1> The <UNK> of the twelve apostles are <UNK> first Simon who is called Peter and <UNK> his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother
<2L1> <UNK> the throne were <UNK> <UNK> and seated on the <UNK> were <UNK> elders clothed in white garments with golden <UNK> on their heads
<2L1> Peter said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death
<2L1> For I have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a <UNK> against her <UNK>
<2L1> And I looked and behold a <UNK> horse And its <UNK> s name was <UNK> and <UNK> followed him And they were given authority over a <UNK> of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with <UNK> and by <UNK> beasts of the earth
<2L1> There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria <UNK> for <UNK> and put us on <UNK>
<2L1> For among them are those who <UNK> into households and <UNK> weak women <UNK> with sins and led astray by various passions
<2L1> in every way and everywhere we accept this with all <UNK>
<2L1> <UNK> in harmony with one another Do not be <UNK> but associate with the <UNK> <UNK> be wise in your own sight
<2L1> but while his men were sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away
<2L1> And there were many <UNK> in Israel in the time of the prophet <UNK> and none of them was <UNK> but only <UNK> the <UNK>
<2L1> And whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
<2L1> And he said to them How many loaves do you have Go and see And when they had found out they said Five and two fish
<2L1> Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him See I have told you
<2L1> Revelation 18
<2L1> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth I have not come to bring peace but a sword
<2L1> Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers <UNK> these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved
<2L1> Now is my soul troubled And what shall I say <UNK> save me from this hour But for this purpose I have come to this hour
<2L1> And they asked him Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come
<2L1> Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the <UNK> of Galilee in the region of the <UNK>
<2L1> But woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation
<2L1> 2 <UNK> 1
<2L1> But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the <UNK> they gathered together
<2L1> In the first book O <UNK> I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach
<2L1> And he commanded the <UNK> to <UNK> and they both went down into the water Philip and the <UNK> and he baptized him
<2L1> For Adam was <UNK> first then <UNK>
<2L1> But I will stay in Ephesus until <UNK>
<2L1> not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God
<2L1> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also
<2L1> <UNK> 4
<2L1> For if we live we live to the Lord and if we die we die to the Lord So then whether we live or whether we die we are the Lord s
<2L1> For you bring some <UNK> things to our ears We wish to know therefore what these things mean
<2L1> And he said to them Truly I say to you there are some standing here who will not <UNK> death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power
<2L1> But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews
<2L1> Slaves obey in everything those who are your earthly masters not by way of eye-service as people-pleasers but with <UNK> of heart <UNK> the Lord
<2L1> Pilate answered What I have written I have written
<2L1> He said <UNK> hundred <UNK> of oil He said to him <UNK> your <UNK> and sit down quickly and write fifty
<2L1> Then the disciples went back to their <UNK>
<2L1> But Jesus on his part did not <UNK> himself to them because he knew all people
<2L1> Woe to them For they walked in the way of <UNK> and <UNK> themselves for the sake of gain to <UNK> s error and <UNK> in <UNK> s rebellion
<2L1> Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains and let those who are inside the city depart and let not those who are out in the country enter it
<2L1> By this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the <UNK> whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God nor is the one who does not love his brother
<2L1> By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance And he went out not knowing where he was going
<2L1> No one <UNK> a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment If he does the patch tears away from it the new from the old and a worse tear is made
<2L1> And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on earth
<2L1> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying He is <UNK> by Beelzebul and by the prince of demons he <UNK> out the demons
<2L1> But Peter standing with the eleven lifted up his voice and addressed them: Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem let this be known to you and give <UNK> to my words
<2L1> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David
<2L1> And she went out and said to her mother For what should I ask And she said The head of John the Baptist
<2L1> The cup of blessing that we bless is it not a <UNK> in the blood of Christ The bread that we break is it not a <UNK> in the body of Christ
<2L1> Did you suffer so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain
<2L1> <UNK> us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints
<2L1> the <UNK> elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever They cast their <UNK> before the throne saying
<2L1> But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God what shall we say That God is <UNK> to <UNK> wrath on us I speak in a human way
<2L1> And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus
<2L1> Jesus said to them <UNK> to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s And they marveled at him
<2L1> and before the throne there was as it were a sea of <UNK> like <UNK> And around the throne on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in <UNK> and <UNK>
<2L1> Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and he said to his disciples Sit here while I go over there and pray
<2L1> After we were brought <UNK> through we then learned that the island was called <UNK>
<2L1> And I know that this man was caught up into <UNK> whether in the body or out of the body I do not know God knows
<2L1> And the angel said to them Fear not for behold I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people
<2L1> <UNK> and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
<2L1> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> strife <UNK> fits of anger <UNK> <UNK> divisions
<2L1> For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God
<2L1> What then is Apollos What is Paul <UNK> through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each
<2L1> but when the sun rose they were <UNK> And since they had no root they withered away
<2L1> They said Caesar s Then he said to them Therefore <UNK> to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s
<2L1> Nevertheless in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to <UNK> others than ten thousand words in a tongue
<2L1> And the high priest stood up and said Have you no answer to make What is it that these men testify against you
<2L1> But I received mercy for this reason that in me as the <UNK> Jesus Christ might <UNK> his perfect patience as an <UNK> to those who were to believe in him for eternal life
<2L1> and Judah the father of <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> the father of <UNK> and <UNK> the father of <UNK>
<2L1> And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him What then will the <UNK> of the vineyard do to them
<2L1> And the <UNK> of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one <UNK> their <UNK> anymore
<2L1> But I have a <UNK> things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of <UNK> who taught <UNK> to put a stumbling <UNK> before the sons of Israel so that they might eat food <UNK> to idols and practice sexual immorality
<2L1> Pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy
<2L1> So every healthy tree bears good fruit but the diseased tree bears bad fruit
<2L1> And we have confidence in the Lord about you that you are doing and will do the things that we command
<2L1> so that he may establish your hearts blameless in <UNK> before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints
<2L1> And when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him
<2L1> So when he heard that <UNK> was <UNK> he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
<2L1> And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon
<2L1> It had a great high wall with twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and on the gates the <UNK> of the twelve <UNK> of the sons of Israel were <UNK>
<2L1> nor thieves nor the greedy nor <UNK> nor <UNK> nor <UNK> will inherit the kingdom of God
<2L1> And now why do you wait Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name
<2L1> and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people And in Antioch the disciples were first called <UNK>
<2L1> and to <UNK> a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord a <UNK> of <UNK> or two young pigeons
<2L1> But we were gentle among you like a nursing mother taking care of her own children
<2L1> I do not ask for these only but also for those who will believe in me through their word
<2L1> The next Sabbath <UNK> the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord
<2L1> Jacob s well was there so Jesus <UNK> as he was from his journey was sitting beside the well It was about the <UNK> hour
<2L1> May the God of peace be with you all Amen
<2L1> Therefore as to the eating of food offered to idols we know that an <UNK> has no <UNK> <UNK> and that there is no God but one
<2L1> And again another Scripture says They will look on him whom they have pierced
<2L1> He who <UNK> is the one who also <UNK> far above all the heavens that he might fill all things
<2L1> if I <UNK> you may know how one ought to <UNK> in the household of God which is the church of the living God a <UNK> and <UNK> of the truth
<2L1> And those who went before and those who followed were shouting <UNK> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
<2L1> But we must run aground on some island
<2L1> and for your sake I am glad that I was not there so that you may believe But let us go to him
<2L1> When he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel
<2L1> persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed
<2L1> Therefore welcome one another as Christ has <UNK> you for the glory of God
<2L1> The eye is the lamp of the body So if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light
<2L1> Let a person <UNK> himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup
<2L1> He opened the <UNK> of the bottomless pit and from the <UNK> rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the <UNK>
<2L1> But if some of the branches were broken off and you although a <UNK> olive <UNK> were grafted in among the others and now share in the <UNK> root of the olive tree
<2L1> and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and <UNK> Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out
<2L1> They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their <UNK> and he sat on them
<2L1> For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to <UNK> <UNK> for his vineyard
<2L1> But Peter said Man I do not know what you are talking about And immediately while he was still speaking the rooster <UNK>
<2L1> And it is my prayer that your love may <UNK> more and more with knowledge and all <UNK>
<2L1> When the disciples saw it they marveled saying How did the fig tree <UNK> at once
<2L1> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: I will open my mouth in parables I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world
<2L1> <UNK> ago at many times and in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets
<2L1> And they had a <UNK> small fish And having blessed them he said that these also should be set before them
<2L1> But as the time of the promise drew near which God had <UNK> to Abraham the people increased and <UNK> in Egypt
<2L1> But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to <UNK> angels in <UNK> gathering
<2L1> This is why I speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand
<2L1> And as they went out of <UNK> a great crowd followed him
<2L1> For with the heart one believes and is justified and with the mouth one confesses and is saved
<2L1> We do not boast beyond <UNK> in the labors of others But our hope is that as your faith <UNK> our <UNK> of <UNK> among you may be greatly <UNK>
<2L1> So also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead
<2L1> But if someone says to you This has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it for the sake of the one who <UNK> you and for the sake of conscience
<2L1> But you have been anointed by the Holy One and you all have knowledge
<2L1> And his disciples asked him Rabbi who <UNK> this man or his parents that he was born blind
<2L1> And Judas and Silas who were themselves prophets encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words
<2L1> For before <UNK> men came from James he was eating with the Gentiles but when they came he drew back and separated himself <UNK> the circumcision <UNK>
<2L1> For we are God s fellow workers You are God s field God s building
<2L1> Acts 10
<2L1> And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder The voice I heard was like the sound of <UNK> <UNK> on their <UNK>
<2L1> Blessed are the <UNK> for they shall be called sons of God
<2L1> When they heard it they marveled And they left him and went away
<2L1> Or those eighteen on whom the <UNK> in <UNK> fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse <UNK> than all the others who lived in Jerusalem
<2L1> Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire so will it be at the close of the age
<2L1> One Sabbath when he went to <UNK> at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees they were watching him carefully
<2L1> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith that you being rooted and <UNK> in love
<2L1> We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you
<2L1> for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer
<2L1> And he is the head of the body the church He is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be <UNK>
<2L1> These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full
<2L1> When the disciples <UNK> the other side they had <UNK> to bring any bread
<2L1> So although I wrote to you it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong but in order that your <UNK> for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God
<2L1> They went to the chief priests and elders and said We have <UNK> bound ourselves by an oath to <UNK> no food till we have killed Paul
<2L1> He killed James the brother of John with the sword
<2L1> For when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them
<2L1> But he replied to the man who told him Who is my mother and who are my brothers
<2L1> He is the <UNK> of the glory of God and the <UNK> <UNK> of his nature and he <UNK> the <UNK> by the word of his power After making <UNK> for sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high
<2L1> <UNK> a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James To those who are called beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus <UNK>
<2L1> For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death
<2L1> And I will give him the morning star
<2L1> You are my friends if you do what I command you
<2L1> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was even calling God his own Father making himself <UNK> with God
<2L1> So you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then an heir through God
<2L1> One of the Cretans a prophet of their own said Cretans are always liars evil beasts <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> The governor again said to them Which of the two do you want me to release for you And they said Barabbas
<2L1> Then they returned and prepared spices and <UNK> On the Sabbath they <UNK> according to the commandment
<2L1> Therefore we are comforted And <UNK> our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all
<2L1> And in the same region there were <UNK> out in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
<2L1> For he was numbered among us and was <UNK> his share in this ministry
<2L1> calling two of his disciples to him sent them to the Lord saying Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
<2L1> And I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened Then another book was opened which is the book of life And the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done
<2L1> I still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> For the <UNK> of God is <UNK> than men and the weakness of God is <UNK> than men
<2L1> testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John <UNK>
<2L1> On behalf of this man I will boast but on my own behalf I will not boast except of my <UNK>
<2L1> Put on the whole <UNK> of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil
<2L1> But the Lord answered her Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things
<2L1> So when they had come together they asked him Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel
<2L1> The first came before him saying ‘Lord your mina has made ten minas more
<2L1> He said to him the third time Simon son of John do you love me Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time Do you love me and he said to him Lord you know everything you know that I love you Jesus said to him <UNK> my sheep
<2L1> Jesus said to them Come and have <UNK> Now none of the disciples dared ask him Who are you They knew it was the Lord
<2L1> And I when I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
<2L1> And she had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord s feet and listened to his teaching
<2L1> <UNK> a close watch on yourself and on the teaching <UNK> in this for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers
<2L1> The <UNK> to the beloved Gaius whom I love in truth
<2L1> If you were of the world the world would love you as its own but because you are not of the world but I chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you
<2L1> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen <UNK> as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to no one except Jews
<2L1> I was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
<2L1> For the one of whom these things are spoken <UNK> to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar
<2L1> And immediately the flow of blood <UNK> up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease
<2L1> on <UNK> <UNK> in danger from rivers danger from robbers danger from my own people danger from Gentiles danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers
<2L1> And this she kept doing for many days Paul having become greatly <UNK> turned and said to the spirit I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her And it came out that very hour
<2L1> But if you have bitter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in your hearts do not boast and be false to the truth
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> The earth <UNK> by itself first the <UNK> then the <UNK> then the full grain in the <UNK>
<2L1> so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: Lord who has believed what he heard from us and to whom has the <UNK> of the Lord been revealed
<2L1> For you have not come to what may be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a <UNK>
<2L1> Be imitators of me as I am of Christ
<2L1> And he was <UNK> before them and his face shone like the sun and his <UNK> became white as light
<2L1> When they had passed the first and the second guard they came to the <UNK> <UNK> leading into the city It opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one <UNK> and immediately the angel left him
<2L1> Therefore go out from their midst and be separate from them says the Lord and touch no unclean thing then I will welcome you
<2L1> Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you this is why we believe that you came from God
<2L1> I counsel you to buy from me gold <UNK> by fire so that you may be rich and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your <UNK> may not be seen and <UNK> to <UNK> your eyes so that you may see
<2L1> And if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
<2L1> Then a great <UNK> arose and some of the scribes of the Pharisees <UNK> stood up and <UNK> <UNK> We find nothing wrong in this man What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him
<2L1> and of <UNK> about <UNK> the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
<2L1> On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem
<2L1> In this the love of God was made manifest among us that God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him
<2L1> But when he who had set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace
<2L1> And he asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven
<2L1> The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to <UNK> and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue
<2L1> It is like <UNK> that a woman took and hid in three <UNK> of <UNK> until it was all <UNK>
<2L1> And I know that his commandment is eternal life What I say therefore I say as the Father has told me
<2L1> After three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions
<2L1> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way
<2L1> <UNK> obey your parents in the Lord for this is right
<2L1> And Jesus answered them Have faith in God
<2L1> When Jesus <UNK> their thoughts he answered them Why do you question in your hearts
<2L1> When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had <UNK> on them because they were like sheep without a <UNK> And he began to teach them many things
<2L1> It has been testified <UNK> What is man that you are <UNK> of him or the son of man that you care for him
<2L1> At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him <UNK> away from here for Herod <UNK> to kill you
<2L1> The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end to him I will give authority over the nations
<2L1> I am the living bread that came down from heaven If anyone <UNK> of this bread he will live forever And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh
<2L1> In <UNK> this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial
<2L1> And the people were shouting The voice of a god and not of a man
<2L1> <UNK> your father and mother this is the first commandment with a promise
<2L1> And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables
<2L1> for we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of the world
<2L1> And he called one of the servants and asked what these things <UNK>
<2L1> For the <UNK> is <UNK> and the way is hard that leads to life and those who find it are <UNK>
<2L1> But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you
<2L1> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
<2L1> saying ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in <UNK> the blood of the prophets
<2L1> But I say to you Do not <UNK> the one who is evil But if anyone <UNK> you on the right <UNK> turn to him the other also
<2L1> for he has looked on the <UNK> <UNK> of his servant For behold from now on all generations will call me blessed
<2L1> for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control
<2L1> So Jesus said to them The light is among you for a little while longer <UNK> while you have the light lest darkness <UNK> you The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
<2L1> And when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness
<2L1> For God commanded <UNK> your father and your mother and <UNK> <UNK> father or mother must surely die
<2L1> But these like <UNK> animals creatures of <UNK> born to be caught and destroyed blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant will also be destroyed in their destruction
<2L1> So if the Son <UNK> you free you will be free indeed
<2L1> But false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will <UNK> bring in <UNK> <UNK> even <UNK> the Master who bought them bringing upon themselves <UNK> destruction
<2L1> But when the grain is <UNK> at once he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come
<2L1> And in the <UNK> watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
<2L1> And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him <UNK> did you not sow good seed in your field How then does it have weeds
<2L1> But each in his own <UNK> Christ the firstfruits then at his coming those who belong to Christ
<2L1> And he said to them Do you not understand this parable How then will you understand all the parables
<2L1> In these you too once walked when you were living in them
<2L1> they will perish but you remain they will all <UNK> out like a garment
<2L1> And they put forward two Joseph called <UNK> who was also called <UNK> and Matthias
