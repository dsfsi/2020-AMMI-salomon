<2L1> For a man was not made from woman but <UNK> for man
<2L1> For when we were with you we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffering just as it has come to pass and just as you know

<2L1> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had <UNK> been blind
<2L1> But Ananias took it and entered the house and laid his hands on him he said <UNK> the Lord Jesus who appeared to on their book that you may that you may obtain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit
<2L1> And immediately he called them and they left their fathers <UNK> in the boat with the high hearts and followed him
<2L1> â€˜But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ The have a wife is her husband and the head of Christ is God
<2L1> This is he who came by water and blood Jesus Christ not by the water only but by the water and of blood And the Spirit is the one who <UNK> because the spirit is the truth
<2L1> And he went down to Capernaum and the city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the Sabbath
<2L1> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> with your <UNK> while you are going with him to court <UNK> your hands you over to the judge and the judge to the judge to the judge and you be put in prison
<2L1> Romans 5
<2L1> And the angel said to them You will be told what you will be told what you are to do
<2L1> So let yourselves therefore to God <UNK> the devil and he will flee from you
<2L1> From now on therefore we regard no one according to the flesh even know we once regarded Christ according to Christ at the flesh we regard him thus no longer
<2L1> Now I was at once and your <UNK> and of to come now there for we are all here in the presence of God to your all the <UNK> by the Lord

<2L1> When the angel who spoke to him and departed he called two of his servants and at the devout soldier from among those who had tempted him
<2L1> And all who worshiped for she was twelve years of age and they were <UNK> <UNK> with the beast And he <UNK> charged them that no one should <UNK>
<2L1> For as it is written The name of God is <UNK> among the Gentiles because of you
<2L1> For this very night there stood before me and angel on the God to whom my beloved and whom my worship
<2L1> For the sake of Christ then I am content with weakness <UNK> <UNK> in idols For when I am weak then I am strong
<2L1> For there are many who are in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> those of the circumcision
<2L1> For if someone comes and proclaim and others Jesus then the one we receive a different spirit or if you <UNK> the one you <UNK> from the one you <UNK> you put up with it <UNK> and enough
<2L1> If one members all suffered together if one never is honor all rejoice together
<2L1> You may him for a little while than the angels You have <UNK> him with glory and honor
<2L1> Truly I say to you you will set him over all his possessions
<2L1> For as the lightning flesh and lights at the sky from one side to the other so will the Son of Man be in his day
<2L1> Likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may be long to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God

<2L1> And when he <UNK> his disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the hour is now <UNK>
<2L1> And he had the <UNK> through <UNK>
<2L1> While they were talking in this <UNK> together Jesus himself drew near and wept with them
<2L1> Let each of us place his neighbor for his good to build up
<2L1> so that we would not be <UNK> by saying For we are not <UNK> it of his signs
<2L1> But if he does not listen <UNK> one or two others alone with you that every charge may be established by the <UNK> of two witness
<2L1> This how should prepare us as servants of Christ and stones of the priests of God
<2L1> and through him to <UNK> himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
<2L1> There is no fear in love the <UNK> loved out fear for fear has to do with <UNK> and whoever <UNK> has not been perfected in love
<2L1> And not find him they returned to Jerusalem and search for him
<2L1> If any of your <UNK> <UNK> let him ask God who gives <UNK> to all without reproach and it will be given him
<2L1> And no one after taking old mine is new For he says The old is good
<2L1> So practice and <UNK> whatever they tell you But not what they do for they do for they preach but do not practice

<2L1> who give <UNK> widows houses and for a <UNK> make long prayers They will receive the greater condemnation
<2L1> And he was long mean to be <UNK> with the palace that the patriarchs and no one gave him anything anything
<2L1> And he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and saying and bound him for a thousand years
<2L1> You will up gold or cry <UNK> open anyone hear his voice and the trees
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of Simeon the son of Joseph the son of Joseph
<2L1> But Saul who was also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit looking <UNK> at him in <UNK>
<2L1> Blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not bow out his sin
<2L1> Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again
<2L1> The <UNK> of the <UNK> will rise up at the judgment of this generation and condemn them for she came from the <UNK> of the earth to hear the wisdom of <UNK> and behold something greater than <UNK> is here
<2L1> For I do not want to see you now just in <UNK> I hope to <UNK> with you if the Lord permits
<2L1> Our fathers refused to obey him but first him aside and in their hearts they turn to Egypt
<2L1> For they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> that the heavens <UNK> to go and the earth was <UNK> out of water and true water by the word of God
<2L1> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the <UNK> I charge you to keep these robes without <UNK> doing nothing from <UNK>
<2L1> while ways of the sea casting up the full of their own shame One in stars for whom the gloom of <UNK> has been reserved for ever

<2L1> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living in the dead and by his <UNK> and his kingdom
<2L1> Now about <UNK> days after these <UNK> he took with him Peter and John and went up on the mountain to pray
<2L1> They answered him Abraham as all Father Jesus said to them If you were Abraham you would be doing the works Abraham did
<2L1> And Paul said John baptize with the baptism of repentance Tell the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is
<2L1> For the master of himself My master is <UNK> in coming and <UNK> to beat the <UNK> and to eat and drink and to eat and drink <UNK>
<2L1> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out they would have had <UNK> to <UNK>
<2L1> For from with envy out of the heart of men come evil thoughts sexual immorality <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> And now seven man to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter
<2L1> And all who worshiped and became strong filled with him And the favor of God was upon him
<2L1> Do not be <UNK> in the <UNK> nor take part in the sins of others <UNK> yourself pure
<2L1> Now this may be <UNK> <UNK> these women are two <UNK> One is from <UNK> I <UNK> for <UNK> she is <UNK>
<2L1> And he said <UNK> his teaching he said <UNK> of the scribes who <UNK> around and <UNK> in the <UNK>
<2L1> And it is up in <UNK> and in the fire and did go water to the <UNK> him What if you can do anything have <UNK> on us and in <UNK>
<2L1> But they went on from <UNK> and came to Antioch and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogues and sat down
<2L1> Then Paul answered What are you doing <UNK> and breaking my heart For I am ready not only to be in prison but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus
<2L1> He received the sign of circumcision as a zeal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised The purpose was to make him the Father of all who believed with <UNK> so that righteousness would be counted to them as well
<2L1> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites For you <UNK> and <UNK> and children And have made <UNK> the <UNK> of the law just and merciful and faithful
<2L1> So put a <UNK> and spoke to sea to <UNK> in <UNK> and all <UNK>
<2L1> And the light of a land will Zion in you no more and the voice of <UNK> and <UNK> will be heard for your <UNK> with a great ones of the <UNK>
<2L1> But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will
<2L1> They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
<2L1> And calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them
<2L1> Now in the place where Jerusalem to take the place in this <UNK> and the <UNK>
<2L1> For as the Father the dead and gives them life so the Son gives life to whom he will
<2L1> Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son and her neighbor
<2L1> <UNK> wicked <UNK> to seek since you <UNK> and these <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> just as you did <UNK> acknowledge us that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you
<2L1> James 4
<2L1> I am the good <UNK> the good <UNK> has life for the sheep
<2L1> But Peter receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous persons will receive a righteous persons reward
<2L1> For even when we were with you we would give you this command if anyone is not willing to work let him not eat
<2L1> and his name by faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and know and the faith of Jesus has given the man this proper in the presence of you all
<2L1> As for what was sown on good <UNK> This is the one who hears the word and <UNK> it he indeed <UNK> fruit and one case a hundredfold and another <UNK>
<2L1> He had still one another a beloved <UNK> <UNK> he sent him to them saying â€˜They will <UNK> my son
<2L1> But if anyone does not <UNK> for his relatives and especially for members of his household He has denied the faith and is worthless then on beloved
<2L1> who do not write these things to make you a chains but to it <UNK> you as my beloved children
<2L1> who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels a authorities and powers having been <UNK> to him
<2L1> And when they had come up through the <UNK> they <UNK> to go into the inner of Jesus did not <UNK> them
<2L1> But what God for twelve by the mouth of all the prophets that his Christ with suffer He thus fulfill
<2L1> <UNK> therefore lest what is set in the Prophets should come about
<2L1> 1 Corinthians 9
<2L1> For this very reason make every <UNK> after to <UNK> your faith with <UNK> and for this
<2L1> and said You Son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness full <UNK> and <UNK> will you not strike <UNK> the <UNK> of the Lord
<2L1> who appeared in glory and spoke of his <UNK> which he was about to a confidence at Jerusalem
<2L1> And they said <UNK> law hear two <UNK> And he said to them It is enough
<2L1> For it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom <UNK> your possessions
<2L1> And these will go away until eternal <UNK> but the righteous into eternal life
<2L1> For to the one who has more will be given and he will have in <UNK> But from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
<2L1> We found the present <UNK> up in the God standing at the <UNK> but when we opened them we found no one inside
<2L1> And if anyone s name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
<2L1> And it once the man was healed and he took up his bed and <UNK> Now that day was the Sabbath
<2L1> On a Sabbath while he was going to the grainfields <UNK> his disciples put in <UNK> and <UNK> them in their hands
<2L1> For I made up my mind not to make another <UNK> visit to you
<2L1> And one of the elders said to me We know small Behold the land of the tribe of David has come so that he had opened the soul and its seals
<2L1> Why do you see the <UNK> that is in your brothers I but do not know us the law
<2L1> and they went away in the boat to <UNK> place by themselves
<2L1> But if you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord death until he comes
<2L1> This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my <UNK> before your face who will prepare your way before him
<2L1> And he realized this he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who were Mark with many were together and were praying
<2L1> Though they were not yet born and had done nothing I are good or bad in order that God s <UNK> might continue not because of works but because of him who calls
<2L1> But the boat was a long way from the land beat by the waves for the wind was against them
<2L1> And he will show you a large upper room <UNK> and ready therefore us
<2L1> But all these things they will do you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
<2L1> saying This is the love of the covenant that God command and for you
<2L1> The Lord will rest you me from every evil deed and bring me <UNK> came to his heavenly kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen
<2L1> So the burial and some of pierced a company and of the <UNK> Aristarchus Aristarchus and <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> and the age <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>
<2L1> And when they came to Jesus they <UNK> with him earnestly saying He is worthy have you do this for him
<2L1> And after there had been much <UNK> Peter stood up and said to them Brothers You know that in the enemy is God made a <UNK> among you that by my mouth the Gentiles and believe
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who worship in kings
<2L1> And Jesus said to him Do you see these great build there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be from down
<2L1> <UNK> 10
<2L1> But on the next day <UNK> to know the <UNK> <UNK> by he was being accused by the Jews he <UNK> the chief priests and all the chief priests and he brought Paul down and set him before them
<2L1> If you are the Christ ask but he said to them If I tell you you will not believe
<2L1> But I have this against you that you have a <UNK> in the love you had it first
<2L1> <UNK> likewise must be <UNK> that devil not a <UNK> to much wine not free for dishonorable
<2L1> And rising very early in the morning while it was still dark he departed and went out to a place and there he prayed
<2L1> Who shall bring any charge against God s <UNK> it is God who <UNK>
<2L1> They do all their deeds to be seen my others for they make their <UNK> <UNK> and their <UNK> alone
<2L1> This is the disciple who is burning witness about these things and who is written these things And we know that is testimony is true
<2L1> And the beast that I <UNK> like a <UNK> its feet was like a <UNK> and its mouth was like a <UNK> and two it the dragon gave his power and great authority
<2L1> Do not speak evil against one another brothers The one who speaks against a brother or judges is evil and judge is the law but if you judge the law you are not a <UNK> but a faith
<2L1> And that hour there was a great earthquake and a <UNK> of the city fell in people were killed and the rest were <UNK> and the rest were <UNK> and gave glory to the God of heaven

<2L1> But while his men will sleeping his enemies came and so weeds among the weak and went away
<2L1> And there were many <UNK> and Israel in the time of the world and none of them was <UNK> but only many named in the surrounding
<2L1> And I do not pray <UNK> if you have everything against anyone so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgiven you your trespasses
<2L1> And he said to them Follow many loaves do you have go and when they had found down they said <UNK> and two fish
<2L1> Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he is going before you to Galilee There you will see him see him see I have told you

<2L1> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also
<2L1> <UNK> 4
<2L1> For if we live we live to the Lord and if we died to the Lord So then whether we live or what we die we die we are the Lord
<2L1> For you bring some <UNK> things to our years We we shall know their <UNK> things mean

<2L1> Woe to them for they walked in the way of came and <UNK> themselves for the sake of gain to <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains and let those who are inside the city depart and let not those who are out in the contrary enter it
<2L1> By this it is <UNK> who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God nor is the one who does not love his brother
<2L1> By faith Abraham obey when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he went out not knowing where he was going

<2L1> The cup of blessing that we blessed is it not a <UNK> in the blood of Christ The bread that we break is it not a <UNK> in the body of Christ
<2L1> Did you suffered so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain
<2L1> <UNK> us <UNK> for the <UNK> of taking part in the <UNK> of the saints

<2L1> so that he may establish your hearts blameless in <UNK> us before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints
<2L1> And when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him

<2L1> And he had found him he brought him to Antioch for a hen and touched a great many people And in <UNK> the disciples were first <UNK>
<2L1> Now there was a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord A marriage of <UNK> or two <UNK>
<2L1> But we were gentle among you like a certificate <UNK> to <UNK> her own children
<2L1> I do not ask for these only but also for those who will believe in me through their word

<2L1> But we must run a ground on so I went
<2L1> And for your sake I was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him
<2L1> When he was <UNK> your old it came into his heart of his brothers that children of Israel
<2L1> <UNK> but not for Satan <UNK> down but not destroy
<2L1> Therefore welcome one another as Christ has well condemned you for the glory of God
<2L1> The I is the <UNK> of the body is the land of the body
<2L1> And he <UNK> and <UNK> himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup
<2L1> he opened the <UNK> of the bottomless pit and from the wrath rolled like the smoke of a great Pharisees and the sun and the air were darkened with the <UNK>
<2L1> But if some of the branches were broken off in you all the a little while all of sheep were grafted in in among the others and now share in the <UNK> word of the <UNK>
<2L1> And also someone who had been healed of evil spirits and in Ephesus Mary called <UNK> from whom seven demons had gone out
<2L1> They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their <UNK> and he sat on them
<2L1> For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house so let up earthly in the morning to hunger as for his vineyard
<2L1> But Peter said Man I do not know what you are talking about And a man was still speaking the rooster <UNK>
<2L1> And it is my prayer that your love may <UNK> more and more with knowledge and all <UNK>
<2L1> When the disciples saw them small saying How did the fig tree withered at once
<2L1> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter what is the <UNK> of the world
<2L1> One will at many times and in many ways God spoke for our fathers by the prophets
<2L1> And they had a <UNK> small fish and having blessed them he said that these also should be set before them
<2L1> But as the time of the promise drew near which God had grant to Abraham the people and <UNK> in Egypt
<2L1> For you have come to Mount <UNK> and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and two <UNK> angels in <UNK> the <UNK>
<2L1> This is why speak to them in parables because <UNK> they do not see and hearing that do not hear nor do they understand
<2L1> And as they went out of <UNK> a great crowd followed him
<2L1> For with the heart one believes sin is justified and with the mouth one confess and is saved
<2L1> We do not boast beyond <UNK> in the <UNK> of others but our hope is that as your faith in praise our <UNK> among you may be greatly in Lord
<2L1> So also faith my itself if it does not have works is dead
<2L1> But if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifices then do not eat it for the sake of the one who <UNK> you and for the sake of conscience
<2L1> But you had been anointed by the holy one and you all have knowledge
<2L1> And his disciples asked him <UNK> who sin this man is <UNK>
<2L1> And Judas and Silas who were themselves <UNK> the brothers with many words
<2L1> For before <UNK> men came from James he was eating with the Gentiles but when they came <UNK> back and separate the circumcision
<2L1> For we are God s fellow workers you are God s <UNK>
<2L1> Acts 10
<2L1> And I heard a voice from heaven like the glory of many waters and like the sound of loud <UNK> The voice I heard was like the sound of <UNK> on their hearts
<2L1> Blessed are the chief <UNK> for they shall be called sons of God
<2L1> When they heard it Satan marveled and they left him and went away
<2L1> Or those Satan on whom the power and Philippi fell and kill them Do you think that they were offended than all the others who lived in Jerusalem
<2L1> just as the weeds are gathered and bought with fire so will it be at the <UNK> of the age
<2L1> One Sabbath when he went to guide the house of the world of the Pharisees they were watchful <UNK> him <UNK>
<2L1> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith that you being <UNK> in ground it and love
<2L1> We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ whom we pray for you
<2L1> For it is made holy by the word of God and prayer
<2L1> and he is the head of the church He is the beginning the beginning from the dead that in everything he might be clean
<2L1> These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full
<2L1> So he left them and departed the disciples <UNK> the other
<2L1> So all though I wrote to you it was not for the sake of the one who did the sake of the one who suffered the one who suffered the wrongdoer that your <UNK> for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God
<2L1> They went to the chief priests and elders and said We has <UNK> bound ourselves by an oath to case no food to we have killed Paul
<2L1> He killed James the brother of John with the sword
<2L1> For when the foolish took their lamps they took no <UNK> with them
<2L1> But he replied to the man who is my mother and who are my brothers
<2L1> He is the readiness of the glory of God and he <UNK> of his nature And he <UNK> the inhabitants of his power after making <UNK> for sins he sat down at the right hand of the <UNK> on high
<2L1> <UNK> a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James To those who are called beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ
<2L1> For the law of the Spirit of life is set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin
<2L1> <UNK> of him the <UNK> stars
<2L1> You are my friends If I command you
<2L1> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he proclaimed the Sabbath but he was even calling God is only himself people with God
<2L1> So you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son that an <UNK> through God
<2L1> One of the Corinthians a prophet of their own said <UNK> are always <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> The <UNK> again said to them We have two do you want me to release for you And they said Who are
<2L1> Then they returned and prepared <UNK> and <UNK> On the Sabbath they <UNK> according to the commandment
<2L1> Therefore we are comforted And be silenced we rejoice still work at the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all
<2L1> And in the same reason there were <UNK> out in the field seeking watch over their flock
<2L1> For he was not murder among us and was a <UNK> that his share in this <UNK>
<2L1> But when two of his disciples to him sent them to the Lord saying Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
<2L1> And I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and book were open then another book was open which is a book of life and the dead were judged <UNK> in the <UNK> to what they had done
<2L1> I still have many things to say to say to you but you cannot bear them now
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> For the foolish of God is wise than men and the witnesses of God is <UNK> than men
<2L1> testify both to Jews and to Greeks of <UNK> God Have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> Was no one <UNK> no widow <UNK> from Galilee after the baptism of the John from <UNK>
<2L1> On the hand of this man I will boast but on my own behalf I will not boast <UNK> my weakness
<2L1> Put on the whole <UNK> of God that you may be able to stand against the <UNK> of the devil
<2L1> But the Lord answered her Mark Mark Mark and trouble of <UNK> many things
<2L1> So when they had come together they asked him Lord what will you at this time <UNK> the kingdom of the kingdom
<2L1> The first came before him saying â€˜Lord your mina has made ten my Lord
<2L1> He said to him the third time Simon son of John do you love me Peter because he said to him the third time <UNK> you love me And he said to him Lord
<2L1> Jesus said to them Come and have <UNK> Now none of the disciples there ask him who are you They no was the Lord
<2L1> For then I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
<2L1> And she had assembled called Mary who sat at the Lord s feet and listened to his teaching
<2L1> keep a <UNK> watch on yourself and on the teaching <UNK> <UNK> in this for by so doing you will say both yourself and your <UNK>
<2L1> The <UNK> to the beloved days whom I love in truth
<2L1> If you were of the world the world would love you as it sown But because you are not of the world but I chose you out of the world therefore the world speaks you
<2L1> Now those who were scattered because of the <UNK> that a <UNK> that a <UNK> is far as the <UNK> and <UNK> speaking the word to no one except Jews
<2L1> I was once a lie from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
<2L1> For the one of whom these things are spoken belong to another <UNK> from which no one has ever served at the altar
<2L1> And immediately the full of blood tried up and she was healed the for diseases And Jesus <UNK> in himself that power
<2L1> On <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> from widows <UNK> your from my own people <UNK> anger in the city <UNK> in the wilderness <UNK> <UNK> at sea <UNK> from false brothers
<2L1> And this she have doing from many days Paul having become <UNK> and said to the Spirit I come man you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her And it came out that very hour
<2L1> But if you have better <UNK> and self-control do not boast and be <UNK> to the truth
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> The earth <UNK> by itself First the plague than the air then the <UNK> in the air
<2L1> will come by the prophet that Isaiah might be fulfilled: Lord who has believed when he heard from us and to whom has the our Lord had been revealed
<2L1> For you have not come to what may be <UNK> fire and darkness and <UNK> and <UNK>
<2L1> The <UNK> of me as I am of Christ
<2L1> And he was <UNK> before them and his face show like this son and his <UNK> became <UNK> as a light
<2L1> When they had passed the second and the second daughter they came to the high in to the city In up and for them of its own accord And they went out and went out and went away empty-handed
<2L1> Therefore go out from their midst and be set it from them says the Lord and touched no unclean thing then I will welcome you
<2L1> Now we know that you know that you know all things and do not me when the question in you This is why we believe that you came from God
<2L1> I come so you to by from me go <UNK> by fire so that you may be rich and my garments so that you may be <UNK> yourself and the shame of your <UNK> may not be seen
<2L1> And if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it But if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
<2L1> Then a great <UNK> and some of the Pharisees stood up and <UNK> <UNK> up in <UNK> We find nothing wrong in this man What if a spirit or a <UNK> to him
<2L1> and of <UNK> about <UNK> The laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead in eternal judgment
<2L1> On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem
<2L1> In this the love of God was made manifest among us that God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him
<2L1> But when he who had set me a part before I was born and who called me by his grace
<2L1> And he asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven
<2L1> The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to <UNK> and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue
<2L1> It is like <UNK> that a woman took and hid in three <UNK> of <UNK> until it was all <UNK>
<2L1> However that his commandment is eternal life what I say therefore I say therefore I say is the Father has told me
<2L1> And on the three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers lest in the <UNK>
<2L1> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled and the same way
<2L1> children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right
<2L1> And Jesus answered them Have faith in God Truly I say to you
<2L1> When Jesus <UNK> their thoughts he answered them Why do you question in your hearts
<2L1> When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and he had <UNK> on because they were like sheep <UNK> about a ship And he began to take the many things
<2L1> It has been testify for him Where is man that you are mine of him or the Son of Man that you care for him
<2L1> At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him <UNK> from <UNK> what to kill you
<2L1> and he rose and who keeps my works into the end to hear my will give authority over the nations
<2L1> I am the living bread that came down from heaven If anyone <UNK> of this bread he will live forever and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh
<2L1> And <UNK> this <UNK> on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial
<2L1> And the people were shouting The voice of God and not of a man
<2L1> <UNK> your father and mother This is the first command with a promise
<2L1> And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said It is not right the rooster given a word of God to serve temples
<2L1> For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of the world
<2L1> And they called one of the servants and asked what these things man
<2L1> For the get is <UNK> and the way is <UNK> and the way is hard that
<2L1> But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you
<2L1> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
<2L1> saying If we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in <UNK> the blood of the prophets
<2L1> But if anyone <UNK> you do not <UNK> the one who was evil but if anyone <UNK> you on the righteous
<2L1> And said My soul <UNK> the Lord and my spirit which is <UNK>
<2L1> For God gave us a spirit not of fear but if power and love and self-control
<2L1> And he said to them Elijah is among you for a little while you have the light <UNK> while you have the light lest darkness does not know where he is going
<2L1> And when they had prayed the place in which they were gathered together and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God was boldness
<2L1> for God commanded honor your father and your mother and Whoever revile father and mother must surely die
<2L1> But these like a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> sword to be <UNK> about <UNK> of its <UNK> will also be <UNK> in their destruction
<2L1> So if the sun Certainly you will be <UNK> and <UNK>
<2L1> But false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teaches among you who will seek and <UNK> of Ephesus even demand the master of about them Bring the master of himself <UNK>
<2L1> But when the grain is right and once seek puts in the temple because the heart has come
<2L1> And in the <UNK> watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
<2L1> And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him <UNK> Did you not so could see in your field how then does it have <UNK>
<2L1> But each in his own accord Christ the first fruits then it is coming those who belong to Christ
<2L1> And he said to them Do you not understand this parable How then we understand all the parables
<2L1> In these you too once want when you were living in them
<2L1> They will perish but you remained They will all without a garment
<2L1> And they put forward about <UNK> Joseph who was also called justice
