<2L1> So there was a vision among the people loved
<2L1> For a man was not made from woman but woman from man
<2L1> For when we were with you we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction just as it has come to pass and just as you know
<2L1> While we were <UNK> for many days a prophet named down from Judea
<2L1> I press brothers by my cry in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die every day
<2L1> 1 Corinthians <UNK>
<2L1> that the man of God may be counted <UNK> for every good work
<2L1> Jesus answered him What I am doing you do not understand now but afterward you will understand
<2L1> If then gave it calls him Lord how is he his son
<2L1> And now your living your servant depart in peace according to your word
<2L1> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called all of it which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath day is John
<2L1> They brought to the Pharisees the man who <UNK> been blind
<2L1> But Ananias departed and entered the house and laid his hands on him he said Brothers saw the Lord Jesus who appeared you on the road that you came and sent me that you may again your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit
<2L1> And immediately he called them and they left their father and the boat with the hired servants and followed him
<2L1> For I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ the head of a wife as her husband and the head of Christ is God
<2L1> This is he who came by water and blood Jesus Christ not by the water only but by the water and the blood And the Spirit is the one who testifies because the spirit is the truth
<2L1> And he went down to Capernaum the city of Galilee and he was teaching them on this <UNK>
<2L1> how to tongues quickly with your <UNK> while you are going with him to court <UNK> <UNK> are hand you over to the judge and the <UNK> to the guard and you be put in prison
<2L1> Romans 5
<2L1> and he rose and to them to the city and you will be told what you are to do
<2L1> <UNK> yourselves therefore to God <UNK> the devil and he will flee from you
<2L1> For now one therefore we regard no one according to the flesh even though we once <UNK> Christ the <UNK> to the flesh we regard him thus no longer
<2L1> Now I fell for you at once and here the kind enough to come now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all the truth have been commanded by the Lord
<2L1> And the next day he took up to <UNK> and gave them to the end people saying Take care of him and whatever more you stand I will repay you when I come back
<2L1> And they had then <UNK> <UNK> prison called Barabbas
<2L1> <UNK> the eyes of your hearts and light that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you and are the riches of his glory as in inheritance in the saints
<2L1> I tell you it is easier for a <UNK> to go through the eye of a <UNK> than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God
<2L1> Greet my <UNK> and <UNK> Greet those in the Lord who belong to the assembly and <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK>
<2L1> Brothers sons of the <UNK> of Abraham and those among you who fear God to us has been sent the message of this salvation
<2L1> and he put them all outside and took the child s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was taking her by the hand he said to her
<2L1> He said In a <UNK> city there was a judge whom neither fear God nor <UNK> man
<2L1> When the angel who spoke to him and departed he called to of his servants and a devout soldiers from among those who <UNK> him and having <UNK> him
<2L1> And he was teaching them walking for she was twelve years of age and they were immediately over come with a nation
<2L1> For as it is written The name of God is <UNK> among the Gentiles be because of you
<2L1> For this very night there stood before me in angel of God to my <UNK> and whom I worship
<2L1> For the sake of Christ then I am content with weakness as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> For when I am weak then I am strong
<2L1> For there are many who are in <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> those of the circumcision <UNK>
<2L1> For if someone comes and <UNK> another Jesus then the one we proclaimed or if you received a different Spirit from the one you received or if you accept the different gospel from the one you except with it ready in off
<2L1> If one members <UNK> all suffered together if one never is honor all <UNK> together
<2L1> You may him for a little while Lord more than the angels you have proud in with glory and honor
<2L1> Truly I say to you he will set him over all his possessions
<2L1> For as the lightning <UNK> and lights at the sky from one side to the other so will the Son of Man be in his day
<2L1> Likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may be long to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may be their fruit for God
<2L1> And everyone who hears the words of the prostitute of this book if anyone <UNK> to them God will at to him the plagues to spread in this book
<2L1> And after she was baptized and her household as well she urged us saying If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord coming to my house in stay and she prepared upon us
<2L1> And John them not more than day he went down to Caesarea and the next day he took his seat on the <UNK> and word Paul to be brought
<2L1> The when he learned his disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the hour is now laid
<2L1> And he had the <UNK> through <UNK>
<2L1> While they were talking in <UNK> together Jesus himself drew near and went with them
<2L1> Let each of us place his neighbor for his good to build him up
<2L1> so that we would not be baptized by Satan For we are not eager of his signs
<2L1> But if he does not listen take one her two others alone with you that every charge may be established by the <UNK> of two or three witnesses
<2L1> This how One should bear us as servants of Christ and stones of the mystery of God
<2L1> and through him to <UNK> to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
<2L1> There is no fear in love the perfect love counts out fear for fear has to do with <UNK> and whoever <UNK> has not been perfected in love
<2L1> And when you not find him they returned to Jerusalem searched for him
<2L1> If any of your tax wisdom let him ask God who gives gentleness to all without reproach and it will be given him
<2L1> And no one after drinking it old wine is new for he says ‘The old is good
<2L1> So practice an <UNK> whatever they tell you but not what they do for they preach but do not practice
<2L1> Yet for love sake I <UNK> to appeal to you I Paul and Paul <UNK> man and now present or also for Christ Jesus
<2L1> who devour widows houses and for a <UNK> make long prayers they will receive the greater condemnation
<2L1> And it was longing to be afraid with the parts that the patriarch saved and no one gave him anything
<2L1> And he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years
<2L1> You will not woe or a cry out nor one hear his voice in the <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of Simeon the son of Joseph the son of Joseph
<2L1> But Saul who was also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit look in Antioch
<2L1> Blessed is the <UNK> against whom the Lord will not care is sin
<2L1> Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again
<2L1> The <UNK> of the <UNK> will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the <UNK> of the earth the hear the wisdom of <UNK> and behold something greater than <UNK> is here
<2L1> For I do not want to see you now just in passing I will <UNK> some time with you if the Lord <UNK>
<2L1> Our fathers refused to obey him but first him aside and in their hearts they charged to Egypt
<2L1> For they delivered over <UNK> this fact that the heavens <UNK> long to go and the earth was <UNK> out of water and threw water by the word of God
<2L1> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these loaves without preaching doing nothing from powerful
<2L1> While pains of the sea casting up the full of their own shame one can <UNK> for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever
<2L1> For all nations have drunk the wine at the passion of her sexual immorality and the kings of the earth of the earth on the <UNK> of the earth have proved from the proud of our <UNK>
<2L1> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living in the dead and by his <UNK> and his kingdom
<2L1> Now about ate days after these things he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray
<2L1> They answered him Abraham all <UNK> all Father Jesus said to them If you are Abraham s children you would be doing the works Abraham did
<2L1> And Paul said John baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is Jesus
<2L1> And he arose and said to himself My master is delivered in coming and <UNK> to beat the <UNK> and to eat and to drink and to drink
<2L1> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out they would have had opportunity to return
<2L1> For from within out of the heart of man come evil thought sexual sexual immorality death murder a <UNK>
<2L1> And as send men to <UNK> and bring one Simon who is called Peter he is Lot
<2L1> And <UNK> the rulers of God was upon him and the <UNK> of God was upon him
<2L1> Do not be <UNK> in the lame out of hands nor take part in the sins of others keep yourself pure
<2L1> Now this may be <UNK> <UNK> these women are two covenant One is from outside I <UNK> children for <UNK> she is <UNK>
<2L1> And Peter teaching he said <UNK> of the scribes who like to walk around and wrong and long robes and like greetings in the marketplace
<2L1> And it is up in <UNK> him and it a water to destroy him What if you can do anything have <UNK> on us and an <UNK> us
<2L1> But they went on from <UNK> and came to Antioch in the city And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down
<2L1> Then Paul answered What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart for I am ready not only to be in prison but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus
<2L1> He received the sign of circumcision as a <UNK> of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised was to make him the Father of all who believed without being circumcised so that righteousness will be counted to them as well
<2L1> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites For you <UNK> and build and children and have made the <UNK> your matters of the law Just as <UNK> and mercy and <UNK>
<2L1> So put away all malice and all deceit to <UNK> in envy and all <UNK>
<2L1> and the light of the Lamb will <UNK> in you no law and the voice of <UNK> and <UNK> will be hurt in you no law for your riches with the great months of the earth and all nations were deceived by your servant
<2L1> But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will
<2L1> They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
<2L1> And calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them
<2L1> As his tomb you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostle should <UNK>
<2L1> For as the Father <UNK> the dead and gives them life so also the Son gives life to whom he will
<2L1> Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth and she bore a son and her neighbor
<2L1> <UNK> wickedness to seek sensuality sensuality and these slander cry <UNK>
<2L1> just as you did <UNK> at knowledge us that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you
<2L1> James 4
<2L1> I am the good <UNK> the good <UNK> down his life for the sheep
<2L1> But who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet s reward and the one who receives a righteous person because he has a righteous person will receive a righteous person will receive a righteous person s reward
<2L1> For even when we were with you we would give you this command if anyone is not willing to work let him not eat
<2L1> and his name by faith in his name has made this man <UNK> whom you see and know and the faith of that is through Jesus has given the man this prophet of you all
<2L1> As for what was sown on good <UNK> this is the one who hears the word and <UNK> it he indeed bears fruit and <UNK> a hundredfold and another <UNK>
<2L1> He had still one another a beloved son Pilate he sent him to them saying ‘They will <UNK> my son
<2L1> But if anyone does not <UNK> for his relatives and especially from members of his household He has denied the faith and is worse than <UNK>
<2L1> Do not write these things to make you ashamed but to <UNK> you as my beloved children
<2L1> who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels authority and powers having been subjected to him
<2L1> And when they had come up in the <UNK> they <UNK> to go into <UNK> but the Spirit of Jesus did not <UNK> them
<2L1> But what God for told by the mouth of all the prophets that his Christ with suffer he thus will fulfill
<2L1> <UNK> therefore lest what is set in the prophet should come about
<2L1> 1 Corinthians 9
<2L1> For this very reason make every <UNK> after <UNK> your faith with <UNK> and <UNK> you with knowledge
<2L1> He said You son of the devil you any of all righteousness full all <UNK> and <UNK> will you not stumble making quickly paths of the Lord
<2L1> who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was about to <UNK> at Jerusalem
<2L1> And they said Look Lord hear two <UNK> And he said to them It is enough
<2L1> For it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom So your possessions
<2L1> And these will go away into eternal question but the righteous into eternal life
<2L1> For to the one who has more will be given and he will have an <UNK> But from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
<2L1> We found the present secure up in the guards standing at the door but when we opened them we found no one inside
<2L1> And if anyone s name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
<2L1> And at once the man was healed and he took up his bed and wash Now that day was the Sabbath
<2L1> On a Sabbath while he was going to the grainfields the disciples fled and hates some heads of grain running them in their hands
<2L1> For I made up my mind not to make another table visit to you
<2L1> And one of the elders said to me We know more Behold the Lamb of the tribe of <UNK> the root of David has come so that he and opened the <UNK>
<2L1> Why do you see the <UNK> that is in your brother s eye but do not <UNK> the law
<2L1> and they went away in the boat to <UNK> place by themselves
<2L1> And as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord s death until he comes
<2L1> This is he of whom it is written ‘Behold I send my <UNK> before your face who will prepare your way before your way before you
<2L1> And immediately he realized this he went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark where many were gathered together and were praying
<2L1> Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bed in order that God s purpose of affliction like continued not because of works but because of him who calls
<2L1> But the boat by this time was a long way from the land beat by the waves for the wind was against them
<2L1> And he will show you a large upper room <UNK> and ready there prepare for us
<2L1> But all these things they will do you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
<2L1> saying This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you
<2L1> The Lord will <UNK> me from every evil deep and bring me <UNK> into his heavenly kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen
<2L1> So the tribune and son of tears accompanied him and of the <UNK> They <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and Gaius and to <UNK> and the ages take up
<2L1> And when they came to Jesus they <UNK> with him earnestly saying He is worthy to have you do this for it
<2L1> And after there had been much the day Peter stood up and said to them Brothers You know that in the order day is God may rejoice among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who were lawful in kings
<2L1> And Jesus said to him Do you see these great <UNK> there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down
<2L1> <UNK> 10
<2L1> But on the next day <UNK> to know the <UNK> reason by the Jews he was being accused by the Jews he <UNK> him and commanded the chief priests and all the <UNK> to eat and he brought Paul down and set him before them
<2L1> If you are the Christ says but he said to them If I tell you you will not believe
<2L1> But I have this against you that you have a <UNK> in the love you had at first
<2L1> <UNK> must be <UNK> not to <UNK> not a <UNK> tongue not <UNK> to much wine not greedy for <UNK>
<2L1> And rising very early in the morning while it was still dark he departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed
<2L1> Who shall bring any charge against God s <UNK> It is God who <UNK>
<2L1> They do all their deeds to be seen by others for they make their full <UNK> brought and their friends long
<2L1> This is the disciple who is burned witness about these things and who was written these things and we know that is testimony is true
<2L1> And the beast that I <UNK> like a <UNK> its feet were like a <UNK> and its mouth was like a lion s mouth and true it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority
<2L1> Do not speak evil against one another brothers the one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speak evil against the law but if you judge the law you judge the law you are not a different of the law
<2L1> And at that hour there was a great earthquake and a tent of the city fell seven thousand people are killed in the earth <UNK> and the rest were <UNK> and gave glory to the God of heaven
<2L1> The means of the twelve apostles are these first Simon who is called Peter and <UNK> his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother
<2L1> around the throne were torn before <UNK> and seated on the throne were torn in white garments with gold <UNK> with gold <UNK> on their heads
<2L1> Peter said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to present and to death
<2L1> Are you come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter and a mother and Saul
<2L1> And I looked and behold a paralytic horse and its mark named was death and hates followed him And they were given authority over four of the earth to kill with famine and with will be <UNK>
<2L1> There the centurion found the ship of Alexandria a <UNK> for <UNK> and put us some <UNK>

<2L1> In every way and every way we accept this with all <UNK>
<2L1> <UNK> harvest with one another do not be <UNK> but as so see ate with the holy never be wise in your own sight
<2L1> But while his men was sleeping his enemies came and so weeds among the wheat and went away
<2L1> And there were many flashes in Israel in the time of the prophet Elijah and none of them was <UNK> but only may him in the Syria
<2L1> and he implored him and pray For give anything against anyone so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
<2L1> And he said to them Are many loaves do you have go and when they had found down they said five adversary
<2L1> Then go <UNK> and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him see I have told you
<2L1> Revelation 18
<2L1> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth I have not come to bring peace but a sword
<2L1> Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers But lest these men speak and shut you cannot be saved
<2L1> Now it is my soul <UNK> and what shall I say Father saved me from this hour but for this purpose I have come to this hour
<2L1> And they asked him Why did the scribe say that first Elijah must come
<2L1> Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Simon to the sea of Galilee in the region of the <UNK>
<2L1> But woe to you who are rich for you have received your consolation

<2L1> But when the Pharisees heard that he had Silas the <UNK> they <UNK> together
<2L1> In the first book <UNK> I have done with all that Jesus began to do and teach
<2L1> And he commanded the Herod to strive and they both went down into the water fell up and the <UNK> baptized him
<2L1> For <UNK> was born first then eat
<2L1> But I will stay in Ephesus until <UNK> us
<2L1> not in the <UNK> of flesh like the Gentiles who do not know God
<2L1> But Paul <UNK> Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many other also
<2L1> <UNK> 4
<2L1> For if we live we live to the Lord and if we die we died to the Lord So then whether we live or whether we die we are the Lord
<2L1> For he brings some <UNK> things to our years when he should therefore what these things mean
<2L1> And he said to them Truly I say to you there are some standing here who will not <UNK> death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power
<2L1> But you would have a <UNK> from the eye but for you have passed over so do you what me to release to you the King of the Jews
<2L1> <UNK> obey in everything those who are your earthly masters not by way of eye-service as people places but with <UNK> <UNK> of heart
<2L1> Pilate answered What I have written I have written
<2L1> He said <UNK> measure of <UNK> he said to him Take your <UNK> sit down quickly and write <UNK>
<2L1> Then the disciples went back to their <UNK>
<2L1> But Jesus on his part did not <UNK> himself to them because he knew all people
<2L1> Woe to them for they walked in the way of came and <UNK> themselves for the sake of gain to <UNK> heirs and <UNK> about him
<2L1> then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains and let those who are inside the city depart and let not those who are out in the country enter it
<2L1> By this it is <UNK> who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil Whoever does not <UNK> righteousness is not of God nor as the one who does not love his brother
<2L1> By faith Abraham obey when he was called to go up to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he went out not knowing where he was going
<2L1> But one does a piece of unshrunk cloth an old garment if he does the patch is away from it the new from the new and a worse tear is made
<2L1> And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who are been slain upon earth
<2L1> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying He is <UNK> by Beelzebul and by the priests of demons he cast out the demons
<2L1> But Peter standing with the eleven lifted up his voice in a test them man of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem Let this be known to you and give Egypt my word
<2L1> So Jesus said to the Son of the Most High God and the Lord God
<2L1> And she went out and said to her For what do us And she said The head of John the Baptist
<2L1> The cup of blessing that we bless is it not of our <UNK> in the blood of Christ The bread that we break is it not a <UNK> in the body of Christ
<2L1> Did you suffer so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain
<2L1> <UNK> us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the revealing of the saints
<2L1> The <UNK> elders followed down before him who is seated on the throne and worshiped him who lives forever and ever they cast their crowds before the throne saying
<2L1> But if our <UNK> service service to show the righteousness of God what shall we say that God is unrighteousness to <UNK> wrath I speak in a human way
<2L1> and my God will <UNK> every <UNK> according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus
<2L1> Jesus said to them <UNK> to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s
<2L1> And before the throne there was as it were a sea of <UNK> like <UNK> and around the throne on each side of the throne our four living creatures full of eyes in <UNK> and behind
<2L1> Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane And he said to his disciples Sit here while I go for there and pray
<2L1> After we were brought <UNK> through we then learned at the island was called <UNK>
<2L1> and I know that this man was caught up into <UNK> whether in the body or out of the body I do not know God knows
<2L1> And the angel said to them You not will I bring you good news of great joy and will be for all the people

<2L1> I <UNK> sexual immorality and the <UNK> <UNK> of anger <UNK> <UNK> of anger <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK>

<2L1> What then is Apollos what is Paul servants through you believe as the Lord assigned to each
<2L1> But when the sun rose they were <UNK> and since they had no root they withered away
<2L1> They said Caesar then he said to them Therefore remember to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s
<2L1> But whoever less <UNK> I would rather be five words with my mind in order to <UNK> others then ten thousand words in a tongue
<2L1> And the high priest stood up and said Have you no answer to make What is it that these men testify against you
<2L1> But I received mercy for this reason that in me as the <UNK> Jesus Christ by <UNK> his perfect patience as an <UNK> to those who were to believe in him for eternal life
<2L1> and <UNK> the father appeared as <UNK> of by <UNK> and Peter is the father of heaven and has from the father of <UNK>
<2L1> And be through him out of the vineyard and killed him What then will the altar of the vineyard do to them
<2L1> And the <UNK> of the earth we and long for her since no one <UNK> their <UNK> go any more
<2L1> And they have a <UNK> against you you have some there who hold the teaching of <UNK> who taught be it to put a stumbling walk before the sons of Israel so that they might eat food sacrifice <UNK> to idols
<2L1> So so loved and earnestly his eye of the Spirit will gifts especially the sexually of side
<2L1> and by their fruits are grapes gathered from thornbushes or fierce from thistles
<2L1> And we have confidence in the Lord about you that you are doing and will do the things that we command
<2L1> so that he may establish your hearts in <UNK> before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints
<2L1> And when she heard it she rose quickly and went to him
<2L1> So when he heard the <UNK> was at all he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
<2L1> And Jesus went away from there and with drew to the district of Tyre and Sidon
<2L1> It had a great high wall with twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and on the gates of the twelve <UNK> of the twelve <UNK> of the sons of Israel
<2L1> nor feeds though the green nor <UNK> nor <UNK> nor <UNK> nor <UNK> will inherit the kingdom of God
<2L1> And now why do you white rise and be baptized and wash your sins calling on his name
<2L1> And when he had found him he brought him to Antioch for all hold years they that with the church in talk a great many people And in Antioch the disciples were first called <UNK>
<2L1> that there was according to what is said in the law of the Lord A prayer of those or two <UNK>
<2L1> But we were trying among you like a mercy neither taking care for her own children
<2L1> I do not ask for these only but also for those who will believe in me through their word
<2L1> The next Sabbath <UNK> the whole city gathered the hear the word of the way
<2L1> <UNK> its <UNK> was there so Jesus <UNK> was from his journey was sitting the side the well It was about the <UNK> hour

<2L1> And for your sake I am glad that I was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him
<2L1> When he was four years old it came into his heart of his brothers that children of Israel
<2L1> persecute but not for Satan <UNK> down but not destroy
<2L1> Therefore walk of one another as Christ is well and you for the glory of God
<2L1> The eye is the <UNK> of the body is the <UNK> and the <UNK> is the Lamb of the body
<2L1> ‘He is an <UNK> himself and so each of the bread and drink of the cup
<2L1> He opened the ship of the bottomless pit and from the ship rose like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened with the <UNK>
<2L1> But if some of the branches were broken off in you all the while <UNK> all of <UNK> were grafted in among the others and now share in the <UNK> of the elders
<2L1> And also some women who had been healed of evil spirits in in <UNK> Mary called <UNK> from whom seven demons had gone out
<2L1> They brought the <UNK> and the colt and put on them their <UNK> and he sat on them
<2L1> For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went outside in the morning in the morning labor labor labor for his vineyard
<2L1> But Peter said Men I do not know what you are talking about And <UNK> he was still speaking the rooster <UNK>
<2L1> and it is my prayer that your love may abounding more and more <UNK> and all <UNK>
<2L1> When the disciples saw them marveled saying How did the fig tree withered at once
<2L1> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world
<2L1> One alone go at many times in many ways God spoke who are fathers by the prophets
<2L1> And they had a <UNK> small fish and having blessed them he said that these also should be set before them
<2L1> But as the time of the promise drew near which God had <UNK> to Abraham the people increased and <UNK> in Egypt
<2L1> I have come to you have come beyond Zion and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to in no <UNK> angels in <UNK> gathered
<2L1> This is why speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand
<2L1> And as they went out of <UNK> a great crowd followed him
<2L1> For with the heart one believed and is justified and with the mouth one confess and is saved
<2L1> we do not boast beyond <UNK> in the <UNK> of others but our hope is that as your faith in promises are arrogant are <UNK> among you may be greatly <UNK>
<2L1> So also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead
<2L1> But if someone says to you this has been <UNK> in sacrifice then do not eat it for the sake of the one who <UNK> you and for the sake of conscience
<2L1> But you had been denied by the holy one and you all have knowledge
<2L1> And his disciples asked him Rabbi whom sin this man is parents that he was born blind
<2L1> and Judas and Silas who were themselves prophets <UNK> and strengthened the brothers with many words
<2L1> For before <UNK> men came from James he was eating with the Gentiles but when they came he drew back and supper <UNK> the circumcision <UNK>
<2L1> For we are God s fellow workers you are God s field
<2L1> Acts 10
<2L1> And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of love thunder The voice I heard who was like the son of harvest putting on their hearts
<2L1> Blessed are the chief <UNK> For they shall be called sons of God
<2L1> When they heard it Being marveled and they left him in the way
<2L1> Or those a <UNK> on whom the <UNK> and fell and killed them Do you think that they were worthless <UNK> than all the others who lived in Jerusalem
<2L1> Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire so will it be at the close of the age
<2L1> One Sabbath when he went to <UNK> the house of the ruler of the Pharisees they were watching and <UNK>
<2L1> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith that you being wrote it in love and love
<2L1> We always thing God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you
<2L1> for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer
<2L1> and he is the head of the body the church He is the beginning the first borne from the dead that in everything he might be predestined
<2L1> These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that you are joy may be full
<2L1> So he left them and departed
<2L1> So although I wrote to you it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong but in order that your <UNK> for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God
<2L1> They went to the chief priests and elders and said We have <UNK> bound ourselves by an oath to takes no food to we have killed Paul
<2L1> He killed James the brother of John with the sword
<2L1> For when the foolish took their lamps they took no <UNK> with them
<2L1> But he replied to the man who told him Who is my mother and who are my brothers
<2L1> He is the right in of the glory of God and the <UNK> of his nature and he <UNK> the <UNK> by the word of his power after making your tradition for sins he sat down at the right hand of the magistrates on high
<2L1> She a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James To those who are called beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ
<2L1> For the law of the Spirit of life as set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death
<2L1> And if him the morning star
<2L1> You are my friends if you do what I command you
<2L1> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking to Sabbath but he was even calling God his own Father making himself people with God
<2L1> So you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then an <UNK> through God
<2L1> One of the <UNK> a prophet of their own said <UNK> are always <UNK> <UNK> slaves <UNK>
<2L1> But the other again said to them We tell a tomb do you what me to release for you And they said listen to this
<2L1> Then they returned and prepared spices an <UNK> on the Sabbath they rescued according to the commandment
<2L1> Therefore we are comforted And be <UNK> O <UNK> we rejoice at the joy of Titus because the Spirit has been <UNK> by you all
<2L1> And in the same region there were <UNK> out in the field keeping watch over their <UNK>
<2L1> For he was never among us and was a <UNK> that his share in this business
<2L1> And to of his disciples to him sent them to the Lord saying Are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
<2L1> And I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and bought were opened then another book was opened which is old life and the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done
<2L1> I still have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> For the foolish of God is wise and men and the weakness of God is <UNK> than men
<2L1> <UNK> to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> For yourselves no one happened through all Judea beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed proclaimed
<2L1> On the have of this man I will boast but on my own behalf I will not boast except by weakness
<2L1> put on the whole <UNK> of God that you may be able to stand against the <UNK> of the devil
<2L1> But the Lord answered her <UNK> Martha you are <UNK> and troubled about many things
<2L1> So when they had come together they asked him Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom of the kingdom
<2L1> The first came before him saying ‘Lord your mina has made ten minas
<2L1> He said to him the third time Simon son of John do you love me Peter was great because he said to him the third time Do you love me And he said to him Lord You are everything You will love you
<2L1> Jesus said to them Come and have robbers Now none of the disciples dared asked him who are you They knew it was the Lord
<2L1> But I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself
<2L1> and she had us his took Mary who sat at the Lord s feet and listened to his teaching
<2L1> keep up close on yourself and on the teaching <UNK> in this for by so doing you will save both yourself and your years
<2L1> The altar to the beloved Gaius whom I love in truth
<2L1> If you were of the world the world would love you as its home but because you are not of the world but I show you out of the world therefore the world hates you
<2L1> Now those who were scattered because of the <UNK> there rose over Stephen <UNK> as far as the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> speaking the word to no one except Jews
<2L1> I was once a lie apart from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
<2L1> For the one of whom these things are spoken along to another <UNK> from which no one has ever served at the altar
<2L1> And immediately the full of blood cried up and she fell in her body that she was healed the fragrance And Jesus receiving in himself that power
<2L1> On <UNK> generations and danger from robbers danger from my own people anger from the city anger in the city anger and the wilderness anger at sea under from false brothers
<2L1> And this she kept doing for many days Paul having become greatly and said to the Spirit I come man you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and it came out that very hour
<2L1> But if you have bitter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in your hearts do not boast and be false to the truth
<2L1> Romans <UNK>
<2L1> the earth <UNK> by itself first the <UNK> than the air than the full grain in the air
<2L1> spoke and by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled Lord who has believed what he heard from us and to whom has the Lord had been revealed
<2L1> For you have not come to what may be touched a <UNK> fire and darkness and gloom and attempt
<2L1> Be imitators of me as I am of Christ
<2L1> And he was <UNK> figurehead before them and his face shone like the son of his <UNK> became like his light
<2L1> When they had passed the first in the second guard they came to the eye am <UNK> into the city It opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went out and went along <UNK> and immediately angel left him
<2L1> Therefore go out from their midst and be <UNK> from them says the Lord and touched no <UNK> thing then I will <UNK> you
<2L1> Now we know that you know that you know all things and do not be anyone <UNK> you This is why we believe that you came from God
<2L1> I come to you to buy from me go over fine fire so that you may be rich and my garments so that you may call yourself and the <UNK> of your naked and self-control your neighbor may not be seen
<2L1> and if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you
<2L1> Then a great <UNK> and some of the scribes of the Pharisees stood up a <UNK> <UNK> we find nothing wrong in this man What if a spirit or a angel spoke to him
<2L1> and a <UNK> about <UNK> the <UNK> on of hands the resurrection of the dead in eternal judgment
<2L1> On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem
<2L1> And this the love of God was made manifest among us that God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him
<2L1> But when he who had set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace
<2L1> And he asked them How many loaves do you have they said Seven
<2L1> The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Capernaum when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue
<2L1> It is like <UNK> that a woman took in him in three <UNK> of <UNK> until it was all <UNK>
<2L1> So though that his commandment is eternal life what I say therefore I say therefore I say as the Father has told me
<2L1> And after three days they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers listened to them and asking them in question
<2L1> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way
<2L1> <UNK> then obey your parents in the Lord for this is right
<2L1> So they answered them Have faith in God
<2L1> When Jesus received their thoughts he answered them Why do you question in your hearts
<2L1> When he went ashore he saw a great crowd and yet <UNK> on them because they were like <UNK> without a <UNK> And he began to teach the many things
<2L1> It has been testified some where is man that you are mine full of him or the Son of Man that you care for him
<2L1> At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him <UNK> from her for her at once to kill you
<2L1> And he <UNK> and who keeps my works until the end to him I will give authority over the nations
<2L1> I am the living bread that came down from heaven If anyone <UNK> of this bread he will live forever and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh
<2L1> In this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for battle
<2L1> And the people were shouting The voice of our God and none of a man
<2L1> <UNK> your father and mother This is the first commandment with a promise
<2L1> And the twelve <UNK> the full number of the disciples and said It is not right the reason the word of God to serve temples
<2L1> For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of the world
<2L1> And he called one of the servants and asked what these things man s man
<2L1> For the <UNK> is <UNK> and the <UNK> is <UNK> and the way is hard that you are <UNK>
<2L1> But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons than the kingdom of God has come upon you
<2L1> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
<2L1> saying If we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in <UNK> the blood of the prophets
<2L1> And it too further but I say to you do not <UNK> the one who was evil but if anyone <UNK> you on the righteous
<2L1> And he said My soul <UNK> the Lord and my spirit <UNK> and God my city here
<2L1> For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control
<2L1> But Peter said to them The light is among you for a little while <UNK> <UNK> one you have the light lest darkness over take you The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
<2L1> And when they had prayed the place they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness
<2L1> for God commanded honor your father and your mother and whoever loves father and mother must surely die
<2L1> but these like a <UNK> animals riches of <UNK> born to be caught in destroyed <UNK> about parents of <UNK> <UNK> also be destroyed in their destruction
<2L1> So if the sons at you free you will be free indeed
<2L1> But false prophets also are <UNK> among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will <UNK> bring in <UNK> of Pharisees even denied the master of about them bringing the bond to destruction
<2L1> But when the grain is right and once he puts in the <UNK> because the harvest has come
<2L1> And in the four watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and <UNK>
<2L1> And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him Master did you not so good seed in your field how then does it have weeds
<2L1> But each in his own <UNK> Christ the first firstfruits then it is coming those who belong to Christ
<2L1> And he said to them Do you not understand this parable how then would you understand all the parables
<2L1> In these you too once walked when you were living in them
<2L1> They will perish but you remain they will all were out like a garment
<2L1> And they put forward to <UNK> So they put a <UNK> <UNK> who was also called justice
