<2L1> So there was a vision among the people love
<2L1> For a man was not made from woman but woman from man from man
<2L1> For when we were with you we kept telling you before hand that we were to suffer affliction just as it has come to pass and just as you know
<2L1> While we were <UNK> for many days a prophet they inquired us came down from Judea
<2L1> I <UNK> brothers by my cry in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die every day
<2L1> 1 Corinthians <UNK>
<2L1> that the man of God may be counted <UNK> for every good work
<2L1> Jesus answered him But I am doing you do not understand now but afterward you will understand
<2L1> If then David calls him Lord how is he his son
<2L1> And now your living your servant did part in peace according to your word
<2L1> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called all of it which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath days during a way of <UNK>
<2L1> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had <UNK> been blind
<2L1> And Ananias departed and entered the house And laid his hands on him he said Brothers saw the Lord Jesus who appeared to him on the order of which you came and sent me that you may remain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit
<2L1> And immediately he called them and they left their father and the boat with the hired servants and followed him
<2L1> But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ the have a wife as her husband and the head of Christ is God
<2L1> This is he who came by water and blood Jesus Christ not by the water only but by the water and the blood And the Spirit is the one who testifies because the Spirit is the Spirit is the truth
<2L1> And he went down to Capernaum a city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the synagogue
<2L1> who come to <UNK> with your <UNK> while you are going with him to court <UNK> <UNK> to the judge and the judge to the guard and you be put in prison
<2L1> Romans 5
<2L1> But he commanded them to the city and you will be told what you are to do
<2L1> <UNK> yourselves therefore to God <UNK> the devil and he will flee from you
<2L1> From now on therefore we be guarded no one according to the flesh even though we once reported Christ to the flesh we regard him thus no longer
<2L1> So he had been for you at once and you would drink and off to come now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to your all that you have been commanded by the Lord
<2L1> And the next day he took out two Gennesaret and gave them to the <UNK> saying Take care of him and whatever more you stand I will repay you when I come back
<2L1> And they had then enough <UNK> as prison have called Barabbas
<2L1> <UNK> the eyes of your hearts and lightning that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you but are the riches of his glory as in inheritance and inheritance
<2L1> Again I tell you it is easier for a <UNK> to go through the eye of a <UNK> than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God
<2L1> Greet my kings men <UNK> Greet those in the Lord who belong to the famine and <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of Peter is the son of Judah

<2L1> He said In the <UNK> city there was a judge whom neither fear God nor <UNK> man
<2L1> When the angel who spoke to him had departed he called to of his servants and at the thoughts silver from among those who intend to him and having them
<2L1> And he gave them walking for she was twelve years of age and they were immediately over come with the beast and he <UNK> charged them that no one
<2L1> For as it is written The name of God is blaspheming among the Gentiles because of you
<2L1> For this very night there stood before me an angel who God to whom my along and whom my worship
<2L1> For the sake of Christ then I am contempt with weakness as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for when I am weak then I am strong
<2L1> For there are many who are <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> those of the circumcision <UNK>
<2L1> For if someone comes and <UNK> another Jesus then the one we <UNK> or if you receive a different Spirit from the one you received or if you accept the different gospel from the one you except with <UNK> you put up with <UNK> enough
<2L1> If one manner <UNK> all suffered together if one number is honor all rejoice together
<2L1> You made him for a little while more than the angels Your crown you with glory and honor
<2L1> Truly I say to you he will set him over all his possessions
<2L1> For as the light <UNK> and flashes at the sky from one side to the other so will the Son of Man be in his day
<2L1> Likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may be longed to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God
<2L1> But everyone who hears the words of the prophets of the <UNK> If anyone <UNK> to them God will at to him the plagues of this book
<2L1> And after she was baptized enter household as well she urged us saying If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come to my house in stay and she prepared the upon us
<2L1> <UNK> than on them all the <UNK> days he went down to Caesarea and the next day he took his seed on the tribe of <UNK> and word Paul to be brought
<2L1> The when they <UNK> his disciples came to him and said This is a desolate place and the hour is now laid
<2L1> And he had the <UNK> through Mary
<2L1> While they were talking in this <UNK> together Jesus himself drew near and went with them
<2L1> Let each of us places neighbor for his good to build him up
<2L1> so that we would not be active by Satan for we are not ignorant of his disciples
<2L1> But if you does not listen take one her two others along with you that every charge may be established by the other and of two or three witnesses
<2L1> This is how once you regard us as servants of Christ and stones of the <UNK> of God
<2L1> and through him to reconciled to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
<2L1> There is no fear and love but <UNK> love cast out fear for fear has to do with <UNK> and whoever <UNK> has not been perfected in love
<2L1> And not find him They returned to Jerusalem searched for him
<2L1> If any of you last <UNK> let him ask God who gives John listen to all without <UNK> and it will be given him
<2L1> And no one after drinking old wine desires new for he says â€˜He hold is good
<2L1> So practice and observed whatever they tell you but not what they do for they preach but do not practice
<2L1> Yet for love s sake I <UNK> to appeal to you I Paul and hold man and now present <UNK> for Christ Jesus
<2L1> who devour widows houses and for a <UNK> make long prayers They will receive the greater condemnation
<2L1> And it was longing to be <UNK> with the parts that the patriarch gave saved And no one gave him anything
<2L1> And he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years
<2L1> You will not cold or cry out nor hear his voice in the <UNK>
<2L1> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of <UNK> the son of Joseph
<2L1> But Saul who was also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit looking at him in Galilee at him
<2L1> Blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not care is sin
<2L1> Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again
<2L1> The <UNK> of the <UNK> will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the <UNK> of the earth to hear the wisdom of <UNK> and behold something greater than <UNK> is here
<2L1> For I do not want to see you now just in passing I hope <UNK> <UNK> with you if the Lord <UNK>
<2L1> Our fathers refused to obey him but first him aside and in their hearts they charged to Egypt
<2L1> For they <UNK> over look this fact that the heavens <UNK> long to go and the earth was thrown out of water and through water by the word of God
<2L1> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rose without preaching doing nothing from No
<2L1> While waves of the sea casting up the full of their own shame one <UNK> for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever
<2L1> For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality and the kings of the earth of the earth of coming with her honor on the <UNK> of the earth have proved from the power of our <UNK>
<2L1> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living in the dead and by his <UNK> and his <UNK>
<2L1> Now about ate days after these <UNK> he took with him Peter and John and went up on the mountain to pray
<2L1> They answered him Abraham Abraham all Father Jesus said to them If you are Abraham s children you would be doing the works Abraham did
<2L1> And Paul said John baptized with the baptism of repentance telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him that is Jesus
<2L1> Therefore do not speak in <UNK> and <UNK> against to beat the <UNK> and to eat and to eat and drink and to drunk
<2L1> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
<2L1> If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out they would have had opportunity to return
<2L1> For from within out of the heart of man come evil thoughts sexual immorality left murder a building
<2L1> And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter
<2L1> And <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of God was upon him
<2L1> Do not be <UNK> in the <UNK> on of hands nor take part in the sins of others keep yourself pure
<2L1> Now this may be gods to Antioch glory These women are two covenant One is from outside I <UNK> children for <UNK> she is hidden
<2L1> And in his teaching he said <UNK> of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and like <UNK> in the marketplace

<2L1> But they went on from broken and came to Antioch at Antioch and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down
<2L1> Then Paul answered What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart for I am writing not only to be in prison but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus
<2L1> He received the sign of circumcision as a <UNK> of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still on circumcised The purpose was to make him the father of all who believed without being circumcised so that righteousness would be counted to them as well
<2L1> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites For you <UNK> and build and children and have made the <UNK> of the law just as in mercy and faith <UNK> these you ought to have done without <UNK> the <UNK> others
<2L1> So put away all malice and brought the sea to <UNK> in the <UNK> and all slander
<2L1> And the light of the Lamb will shine in you no more and the voice of <UNK> and bright will be heard in you no more <UNK> with the great months of the earth and all nations were deceived by your <UNK>
<2L1> But we believe that we will be saved for the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will
<2L1> They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience
<2L1> And calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them
<2L1> That is to you who chosen to take the place in this ministry and the <UNK> from which Jews
<2L1> For as the Father <UNK> is the dead and gives them life so also the Son gives life to whom he will

<2L1> Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophets through word and the one who receives a righteous person because he has <UNK> person will receive a righteous person will receive a righteous persons reward
<2L1> For even when we were with you we would give you this command if anyone does not willing to work let him not eat
<2L1> and his name by faith in his name has made this <UNK> whom you see and the faith of that is through Jesus has given the man this proper palace in the presence of you all
<2L1> As for what was sown on good <UNK> This is the one who hears the word and <UNK> it indeed bears fruit and <UNK> a hundredfold and another <UNK> and another <UNK>
<2L1> He had still one another a beloved son <UNK> where he sent him to them saying â€˜They will <UNK> my son
<2L1> But if anyone does not <UNK> for his relatives and especially from members of his household He has denied the faith and his works then a <UNK>
<2L1> Do not write these things to make you ashamed but to <UNK> you as my beloved children
<2L1> who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels authorities and powers having been subjected to him
<2L1> And when they had come up in the <UNK> they attention to go into <UNK> but the Spirit of Jesus did not <UNK> them
<2L1> But what God for told by the mouth of all the prophets that is Christ with suffer he thus fulfill
<2L1> <UNK> therefore lest what is set in the prophets should come about
<2L1> 1 Corinthians 9
<2L1> For this very reason make every <UNK> make every <UNK> with your faith with <UNK> and for you with knowledge
<2L1> he said You son of the devil you any of all righteousness full of all deceitful and building will you not setting <UNK> the <UNK> of the Lord
<2L1> who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplished at Jerusalem
<2L1> And they said Look Lord here are two sword And he said to them It is you nothing And
<2L1> for as your Father is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom
<2L1> And these will go away into eternal question but the righteous into eternal life

<2L1> <UNK> down the prison <UNK> up in the guards standing at the door but when we opened them we found no one inside
<2L1> And if anyone s name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
<2L1> And at once the man was healed and he took up his bed and mocked Now that day was the Sabbath
<2L1> On a Sabbath while he was going to the grainfields his disciples fled and ate some heads of grain wrapped in their hands
<2L1> For I made up my mind not to make another pains of visit to you
<2L1> And one of the elders said to me â€˜We no more Behold the mind of the tribe of <UNK> the root of David has called so that he and opened the <UNK> and its seals
<2L1> Why do you see the <UNK> that is in your brother s eye but do not know as the <UNK>
<2L1> And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves
<2L1> And invited you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord death until he comes
<2L1> This is he of whom it is written â€˜Behold I send my <UNK> before your face who will prepare your way before you
<2L1> And immediately he realized this he went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark where many were gathered together and were praying
<2L1> Though they were not yet born and had done nothing by their good or bed in order that God s <UNK> of the affliction might continue not because of works but because of him who calls
<2L1> But the boat by this time was a long way from the land being by the waves for the wind was against them
<2L1> And he will show you a large upper room <UNK> and ready there prepare for us
<2L1> But all these things they will do you on account of my name because they do not know him who sent me
<2L1> saying This is the love of the covenant that God commanded for you
<2L1> The Lord will <UNK> me from every evil deed and bring me safe into his heavenly kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen

<2L1> And when they came to Jesus they treated with him earnestly saying He is worthy to have you do this for him
<2L1> And after there had been much today Peter stood up and said to them Brothers you know that in the Areopagus God may rejoice among you The by my mouth of the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe
<2L1> What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft clothing Behold those who worse off clothing are and came s houses

<2L1> So he <UNK> in himself that I may <UNK> and so each of the bread and drink of the cup
<2L1> He opened the ship of the bottomless pit and from the ship scroll like the smoke of a great purpose and the sun and the sun were darkened with the smoke from the ship
<2L1> But if some of the branches were broken off in you although a while all of you were grafted in among the others and now share in the <UNK> of the hell of the <UNK>
<2L1> And also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and in <UNK> Mary called <UNK> from whom seven demons had gone out

<2L1> When the disciples saw them marveled saying How did the fig tree withered at once
<2L1> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter what is been hidden since the foundation of the world
<2L1> One long ago at many times and in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets
<2L1> And they had a <UNK> small fish and having blessed them he said that these also should be set before them
<2L1> But as the time of the promise drew near which God <UNK> to Abraham the people and crucified him
<2L1> I have come to you who have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living Jerusalem and to in no <UNK> angels and <UNK> gathered
<2L1> This is why be to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand
<2L1> And as they went out of <UNK> great crowd followed him
<2L1> For with the heart one believed and his justified and with the mouth one confesses and his saved
<2L1> We do not boast beyond <UNK> in the <UNK> of others but our hope is that as your faith in priests is our <UNK> our <UNK> of <UNK> among you may be <UNK> in the <UNK>
<2L1> So also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead

<2L1> But you had been anointed by the holy one and you all have knowledge
<2L1> And his disciples asked him Rabbi who sent this man is parents that he was born blind
<2L1> And Judas and Silas who were astonished encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words
<2L1> For before <UNK> men came from <UNK> he was eating with the Gentiles but when they came Teacher back and separate himself <UNK> the circumcision <UNK>

<2L1> Acts 10
<2L1> And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder The voice I heard it was like the sound of harvest plain on their hearts
<2L1> Blessed are the chief <UNK> for they shall be called sons of God
<2L1> When they heard it they marveled And they left him and went away
<2L1> Or those native king on whom the hour and I long fell and kill them Do you think that they were <UNK> than all the others who lived in Jerusalem
<2L1> Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire so will it be at the <UNK> of the age
<2L1> One Sabbath when he went to die at the house of the ruler of the Pharisees they were watching and Derbe

<2L1> So he left them and departed when the disciples rebuked the other son
<2L1> So although I wrote to you it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong nor for the sake of the wrong but in order that your <UNK> for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God

<2L1> He killed James the brother of John with the sword
<2L1> For when the foolish took their lamps they took no oil with them

<2L1> So you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son that an heir through God
<2L1> One of the <UNK> a prophet of their own said Greetings are always <UNK> evil beast later <UNK> <UNK>

<2L1> Jesus said to them Come and have <UNK> Now none of the disciples dared asked him who are you They knew it was the Lord

<2L1> I was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and I died
<2L1> For the one of whom these things are spoken along to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar
<2L1> And immediately the full of blood arrayed up and she fell and her body that she was healed of her diseases

<2L1> On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem
<2L1> In this the love of God was made manifest among us that God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him
<2L1> But when he who had set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace
<2L1> And he asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven
<2L1> The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to heal and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue

<2L1> It has been testified Some where is man that you are mine loved him for the Son of Man that you care for him

<2L1> On her father and mother This is the first commandment with the promise
<2L1> And the twelve <UNK> the full number of the disciples and said It is not right the reason the word of God to serve temples
