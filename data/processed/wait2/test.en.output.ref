<2L1> For they say His letters are <UNK> and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account
<2L1> for it was said to me by the word of the LORD You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there nor return by the way that you came
<2L1> You shall say to them Thus says the LORD the God of Israel Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
<2L1> But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you so the LORD will bring upon you all the evil things until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the LORD your God has given you
<2L1> O you hope of Israel its savior in time of trouble why should you be like a stranger in the land like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night
<2L1> And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron s head and anointed him to consecrate him
<2L1> When the tabernacle is to set out the Levites shall take it down and when the tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall set it up And if any outsider comes near he shall be put to death
<2L1> And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they abandoned their cities and fled And the Philistines came and lived in them
<2L1> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you
<2L1> Isaiah 52
<2L1> Isaiah 50
<2L1> Declare his glory among the nations his marvelous works among all the peoples
<2L1> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I come and see you or am absent I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel
<2L1> And you shall take no bribe for a bribe blinds the clear <UNK> and subverts the cause of those who are in the right
<2L1> And at this sound the multitude came together and they were <UNK> because each one was hearing them speak in his own language
<2L1> a people who provoke me to my face continually sacrificing in gardens and making offerings on bricks
<2L1> and lusted after her <UNK> there whose members were like those of donkeys and whose issue was like that of horses
<2L1> In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold which they made for themselves to worship to the <UNK> and to the <UNK>
<2L1> Take from them silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest
<2L1> and for the sacrifice of peace offerings two oxen five rams five male goats and five male lambs a year old This was the offering of Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur
<2L1> he may pile it up but the righteous will wear it and the innocent will divide the silver
<2L1> All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you and put darkness on your land declares the Lord GOD
<2L1> Kenan Mahalalel Jared
<2L1> for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given but sin is not counted where there is no law
<2L1> When Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered them Why do you question in your hearts
<2L1> Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the tax collector James the son of Alphaeus and <UNK>
<2L1> Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD I am weary of holding it in Pour it out upon the children in the street and upon the <UNK> of young men also both husband and wife shall be taken the <UNK> and the very aged
<2L1> I do not receive glory from people
<2L1> So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome
<2L1> Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God and David their king and they shall come in fear to the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days
<2L1> Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him
<2L1> If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ who was I that I could stand in God s way
<2L1> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he gave no answer
<2L1> And they set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth
<2L1> And he rose and went home
<2L1> For as it is written The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you
<2L1> For if you return to the LORD your brothers and your children will find compassion with their captors and return to this land For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if you return to him
<2L1> Whoever restrains his words has knowledge and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding
<2L1> John 16
<2L1> Now Laban had two daughters The name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel
<2L1> And the LORD said by his servants the prophets
<2L1> then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers
<2L1> All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever
<2L1> For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom There will be earthquakes in various places there will be famines These are but the beginning of the birth pains
<2L1> And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day and not a man of them escaped except four hundred young men who mounted camels and fled
<2L1> Then I looked and behold a form that had the appearance of a man Below what appeared to be his waist was fire and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness like gleaming metal
<2L1> Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had <UNK> in doing it and behold all was vanity and a striving after wind and there was nothing to be gained under the sun
<2L1> The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith and he who <UNK> with the hammer him who strikes the <UNK> saying of the <UNK> It is good and they strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved
<2L1> 2 Kings 18
<2L1> David was clothed with a robe of fine linen as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers And David wore a linen ephod
<2L1> Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me and I will dwell in their midst forever
<2L1> The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark they shall not be taken from it
<2L1> And when they cried to the LORD he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt And you lived in the wilderness a long time
<2L1> saying A hand upon the throne of the LORD The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation
<2L1> For when Herodias s daughter came in and danced she pleased Herod and his guests And the king said to the girl Ask me for whatever you wish and I will give it to you
<2L1> The people of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam did They did not depart from them
<2L1> When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword
<2L1> Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple and I looked and behold the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD And I fell on my face
<2L1> And they came to Ephesus and he left them there but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews
<2L1> that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions I will punish the altars of Bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground
<2L1> So also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great things How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire
<2L1> A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden and there it divided and became four rivers
<2L1> And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last
<2L1> The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place
<2L1> Then the men of Israel turned and the men of Benjamin were dismayed for they saw that disaster was close upon them
<2L1> And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues saying He is the Son of God
<2L1> Truly you are a God who hides himself O God of Israel the Savior
<2L1> A drought against her waters that they may be dried up For it is a land of images and they are mad over idols
<2L1> What I am saying with this boastful confidence I say not with the Lord s authority but as a fool
<2L1> Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea he shall become a <UNK> for ships and his border shall be at Sidon
<2L1> In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen and repair its breaches and raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old
<2L1> And if the Lord had not cut short the days no human being would be saved But for the sake of the elect whom he chose he shortened the days
<2L1> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man rather she is to remain quiet
<2L1> Yet let no one contend and let none accuse for with you is my contention O priest
<2L1> You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the LORD your God that you shall make
<2L1> And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions
<2L1> Haggai 2
<2L1> But you dress yourself for work arise and say to them everything that I command you Do not be dismayed by them lest I dismay you before them
<2L1> Jesus answered them Do you now believe
<2L1> So he prepared for them a great feast and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master And the Syrians did not come again on raids into the land of Israel
<2L1> That food shall be a <UNK> for the land against the seven years of famine that are to <UNK> in the land of Egypt so that the land may not perish through the famine
<2L1> Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son the LORD your God disciplines you
<2L1> 1 Samuel 25
<2L1> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim these Moses had struck and driven out
<2L1> he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said
<2L1> So if you consider me your partner receive him as you would receive me
<2L1> And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year and see that you act quickly But the Levites did not act quickly
<2L1> Now therefore Tattenai governor of the province Beyond the River Shethar bozenai and your associates the governors who are in the province Beyond the River keep away
<2L1> Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting
<2L1> And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book
<2L1> And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham
<2L1> For when we were with you we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction just as it has come to pass and just as you know
<2L1> The sons of Izhar Shelomith the chief
<2L1> these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit For the Spirit searches everything even the depths of God
<2L1> also one male goat for a sin offering besides the regular burnt offering its grain offering and its drink offerings
<2L1> Mizpeh Chephirah <UNK>
<2L1> And they demolished the pillar of Baal and demolished the house of Baal and made it a <UNK> to this day
<2L1> but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood
<2L1> Hepher the <UNK> Ahijah the Pelonite
<2L1> The sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi These are the clans of the Levites according to their fathers
<2L1> They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the Kidron Valley
<2L1> At the noise of the <UNK> of the hoofs of his stallions at the rushing of his chariots at the rumbling of their wheels the fathers look not back to their children so feeble are their hands
<2L1> Then they will say Because they abandoned the LORD the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them
<2L1> For the LORD has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him
<2L1> It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound was healed
<2L1> Of the priests Jedaiah the son of Joiarib Jachin
<2L1> But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron saying You have killed the people of the LORD
<2L1> And the four living creatures each of them with six wings are full of eyes all around and within and day and night they never cease to say Holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come
<2L1> So from that day on they made plans to put him to death
<2L1> And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland from the tribe of Reuben and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh
<2L1> And I will give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you with knowledge and understanding
<2L1> If the place that the LORD your God will choose to put his name there is too far from you then you may kill any of your herd or your flock which the LORD has given you as I have commanded you and you may eat within your towns whenever you desire
<2L1> Then he went into the gateway facing east going up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate one reed deep
<2L1> And he said to them Let us go on to the next towns that I may preach there also for that is why I came out
<2L1> Moreover you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether whom he killed avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet
<2L1> And David inquired of God Shall I go up against the Philistines Will you give them into my hand And the LORD said to him Go up and I will give them into your hand
<2L1> If a revelation is made to another sitting there let the first be silent
<2L1> And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you They shall be male and female
<2L1> so now I have come out to meet you to seek you eagerly and I have found you
<2L1> Shaaraim <UNK> Gederah <UNK> fourteen cities with their villages
<2L1> And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army
<2L1> And he went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches
<2L1> How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out That their calamity comes upon them That God <UNK> pains in his anger
<2L1> one cherub on the one end and one cherub on the other end Of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends
<2L1> For thus says the LORD To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant
<2L1> Let those curse it who curse the day who are ready to rouse up Leviathan
<2L1> I am the one who bears witness about myself and the Father who sent me bears witness about me
<2L1> And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal tamar and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from <UNK> <UNK>
<2L1> And Moab was in great dread of the people because they were many Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel
<2L1> For I tell you none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet
<2L1> Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him
<2L1> Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea
<2L1> also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering mixed with a quarter of a hin of beaten oil
<2L1> my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city
<2L1> Then the servants drew near they and their children and bowed down
<2L1> When Pharaoh heard of it he sought to kill Moses But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian And he sat down by a well
<2L1> therefore behold I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male both bond and free in Israel and will burn up the house of Jeroboam as a man burns up dung until it is all gone
<2L1> Then Menahem the son of <UNK> came up from Tirzah and came to Samaria and he struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and put him to death and reigned in his place
<2L1> They shall roar together like lions they shall growl like lions cubs
<2L1> And behold you have risen in your fathers place a brood of sinful men to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel
<2L1> And you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your towns for he has no portion or inheritance with you
<2L1> If you will not listen if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name says the LORD of hosts then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings Indeed I have already cursed them because you do not lay it to heart
<2L1> Therefore we are comforted And besides our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all
<2L1> You stripped the sheath from your bow calling for many arrows Selah You split the earth with rivers
<2L1> And he said See that you are not led astray For many will come in my name saying I am he and The time is at hand Do not go after them
<2L1> But Jehoiada grew old and full of days and died He was years old at his death
<2L1> his offering was one silver plate whose weight was shekels one silver basin of shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering
<2L1> And listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place And listen from heaven your dwelling place and when you hear forgive
<2L1> And he brought us out from there that he might bring us in and give us the land that he swore to give to our fathers
<2L1> Blessed shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be in the field
<2L1> You ask and do not receive because you ask <UNK> to spend it on your passions
<2L1> for our God is a consuming fire
<2L1> Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at <UNK> The people who were with him were about six hundred men
<2L1> So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you which is your glory

<2L1> They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem s house and went away
<2L1> But Jesus looked at them and said With man this is impossible but with God all things are possible
<2L1> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these
<2L1> in En rimmon in Zorah in Jarmuth
<2L1> But go act be strong for the battle Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy For God has power to help or to cast down
<2L1> You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men
<2L1> who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God
<2L1> For thus says the LORD of hosts the God of Israel I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and they shall serve him for I have given to him even the beasts of the field
<2L1> When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive he led forth his trained men born in his house of them and went in pursuit as far as Dan
<2L1> And he put the servants with their children in front then Leah with her children and Rachel and Joseph last of all
<2L1> Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out in the council Brothers I am a Pharisee a son of Pharisees It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial
<2L1> and he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised
<2L1> But you say If a man tells his father or his mother Whatever you would have gained from me is <UNK> that is given to God
<2L1> You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law
<2L1> If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city he may redeem it within a year of its sale For a full year he shall have the right of redemption
<2L1> After all this when Josiah had prepared the temple Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah went out to meet him
<2L1> For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had broken down and he erected altars to the Baals and made <UNK> and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them
<2L1> Son of man when the house of Israel lived in their own land they defiled it by their ways and their deeds Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity
<2L1> And immediately the flow of blood dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease
<2L1> And let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing
<2L1> Before the mountains had been shaped before the hills I was brought forth
<2L1> After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision Fear not Abram I am your shield your reward shall be very great
<2L1> Five curtains shall be coupled to one another and the other five curtains shall be coupled to one another
<2L1> You are witnesses of these things
<2L1> And Shuppim and Huppim were the sons of Ir Hushim the son of <UNK>
<2L1> And the people of Israel said to Moses Behold we perish we are undone we are all undone
<2L1> What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you Is it not this that your passions are at war within you
<2L1> All these were made of costly stones cut according to measure <UNK> with saws back and front even from the foundation to the <UNK> and from the outside to the great court
<2L1> I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth
<2L1> And they attacked all the cities around Gerar for the fear of the LORD was upon them They plundered all the cities for there was much plunder in them
<2L1> And Paul said Whether short or long I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am except for these chains
<2L1> He searched for Ahaziah and he was captured while hiding in Samaria and he was brought to Jehu and put to death They buried him for they said He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom
<2L1> We must all die we are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again But God will not take away life and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast
<2L1> And he said Why what evil has he done But they shouted all the more Let him be crucified
<2L1> Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra A disciple was there named Timothy the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a Greek
<2L1> Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD I have sinned for I did not know that you stood in the road against me Now therefore if it is evil in your sight I will turn back
<2L1> and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ
<2L1> And I when I came to you brothers did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom
<2L1> These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit
<2L1> the princes of Issachar came with Deborah and Issachar faithful to Barak into the valley they rushed at his heels Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart
<2L1> then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood in accordance with these rules
<2L1> but when the sun rose they were scorched And since they had no root they withered away
<2L1> for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood
<2L1> And at the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me
<2L1> Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you brothers
<2L1> as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness From them I received letters to the brothers and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished
<2L1> And he seized all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of God in the care of Obed edom He seized also the treasuries of the king s house also <UNK> and he returned to Samaria
<2L1> Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran
<2L1> Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen
<2L1> Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known and because they have filled this place with the blood of <UNK>
<2L1> She said No one Lord And Jesus said Neither do I condemn you go and from now on sin no more
<2L1> So all the men of Israel gathered against the city united as one man
<2L1> And she had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord s feet and listened to his teaching
<2L1> Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said Because they did not go with us we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered except that each man may lead away his wife and children and depart
<2L1> If Edom says We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins the LORD of hosts says They may build but I will tear down and they will be called the wicked country and the people with whom the LORD is angry forever
<2L1> And all were weeping and mourning for her but he said Do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping
<2L1> Then the LORD said I have <UNK> according to your word
<2L1> And as he came out of the temple one of his disciples said to him Look Teacher what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings
<2L1> Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people And they said All that the LORD has spoken we will do and we will be obedient
<2L1> Yet the house of Israel says The way of the Lord is not just O house of Israel are my ways not just Is it not your ways that are not just
<2L1> Likewise when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing they too followed hard after them in the battle
<2L1> And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you
<2L1> and sent forth a raven It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth
<2L1> A little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest
<2L1> You have made us <UNK> and <UNK> among the peoples
<2L1> And Zechariah said to the angel How shall I know this For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years
<2L1> Yet in like manner these people also <UNK> on their dreams defile the flesh reject authority and blaspheme the glorious ones
<2L1> and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior
<2L1> Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets Yet they would not give ear Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands
<2L1> And the thin ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows
<2L1> And every garment and every skin on which the semen comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening
<2L1> Then Laban answered and said to Jacob The daughters are my daughters the children are my children the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne
<2L1> And Jesus said to them Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast
<2L1> Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the people of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
<2L1> Laban said This heap is a witness between you and me today Therefore he named it Galeed
<2L1> Then Shaphan the secretary told the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book And Shaphan read it before the king
<2L1> It is not the old who are wise nor the aged who understand what is right
<2L1> He measured it on the four sides It had a wall around it cubits long and cubits broad to make a separation between the holy and the common
<2L1> Then the disciples went back to their homes
<2L1> since God is one who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith
<2L1> And these were the chief officers of King Solomon who <UNK> authority over the people
<2L1> For thus says the LORD Behold I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time and I will bring distress on them that they may feel it
<2L1> And I will let loose the wild beasts against you which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you few in number so that your roads shall be deserted
<2L1> And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city And when they come out against us just as before we shall flee before them
<2L1> But the anointing that you received from him abides in you and you have no need that anyone should teach you But as his anointing teaches you about everything and is true and is no lie just as it has taught you abide in him

<2L1> Listen to me you who pursue righteousness you who seek the LORD look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the quarry from which you were dug
